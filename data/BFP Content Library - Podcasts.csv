22725,Laurie Lee,https://businessfightspoverty.org/an-interview-with-laurie-lee-new-ceo-of-care-in-the-uk,"I recently had the opportunity to interview Laurie Lee, the new CEO of CARE International UK. I asked him about CARE&#8217;s engagement with business, and his vision for the future. This is an edited version of our conversation. You can listen to the audio of the full interview below. BFP: You Tweeted the other day about Banking on Change, your partnership with Barclays and Plan to increase access to basic financial services. It’s a project we’ve featured on Business Fights Poverty. Can you tell us more about your vision for partnering with business to achieve social impact? LL: The role of business and the private sector is central to development. We are talking about reducing poverty in countries where there is not a lot of access to formal jobs. Helping poor people is about entrepreneurship and enabling them to make a living. There are three ways in which working with business can help: First, business helps us achieve scale &#8211; helping us reach many more poor people than we can on our own. If we can work with those businesses on how they interact with their many customers and suppliers then we can have a big impact. Second, business can help us achieve sustainability. We want to achieve change that will continue helping people beyond our role as a charity. If we can make sure that we can help people in a way which is profitable and good business for these companies, then they eventually can take that on without our support. And third, business can help drive innovation. There is a lot of capacity and ability to innovate in the private sector. Partnering with companies can help us challenge ourselves to be as innovative as possible in coming up with solutions to problems that we are addressing. Banking on Change is a good example of the way we partner. The work that we’ve been specifically doing with Barclays began with scaling up what we call Village Savings and Loans Associations, whereby groups of people – usually mainly women – come together and support each other and save a little bit of income each month. At the end of the year they have an amount that can allow them to invest in a small business or pay for health or education. That first phase, in the first few years, reached half a million people – mostly women. As we moved into the second phase we focused on expanding the impact of the programme by linking the individual Village Savings and Loans Associations, who would just save money in a box, with the formal financial sector – helping them get more and more benefits from savings, and eventually other financial services. We’re now starting to work with Barclays, as well as lots of other banks, mobile phone providers, government regulators and other companies, to distil the lessons we and Barclays have learned from the programme – with the aim of bringing more and more people into formal financial services in a responsible way. We are encouraging companies, Governments and other organisations to sign up to a Charter of best practice principles. BFP: What makes for a successful partnership with business – and what practical advice do you have for those individuals working in NGOs and in business who are looking at how to build an effective partnership? LL: I think like any relationship it’s important that you get to know each other and it’s important that you have some kind of overlap in your values and what you are trying to achieve. At the same time, a big opportunity is that you also bring different, complementary things to the partnership. I think it’s important to take the time checking those things in the beginning; the upfront investment in making sure that everyone is in agreement about why they are working together and what they are working towards is really crucial. I think it’s also important always to be challenging each other to be innovative, to be ambitious, to meet the targets, and to be learning and adjusting as they go. BFP: In the partnerships that CARE participates in, what is the specific value you bring to the partnership? If a business wants to partner with you, how can they go about it? LL: I think one of the things that we bring, and that many business partners look to us for, is our deep understanding of the communities that they want to reach. CARE has worked for many decades with communities in the poorest parts of the world, taking the time to understand the underlying causes of poverty and vulnerability in those communities, and what the real needs are. I think we also bring a challenge function: we are involved in pushing companies to be ambitious and helping them think about whether there are opportunities they’ve not thought of in terms of working with poor people as potential suppliers or customers. We have worked with the private sector for a long time, and we have always seen the importance of the private sector’s role in development. So we have a good understanding of what the need, approaches and constraints of the private sector tend to be. I think that helps us get more quickly to a constructive partnership. We have a very experienced team that manages our partnerships and can start a conversation with companies interested in any of our priority areas (such as women’s economic empowerment, food security, and sexual and reproductive health). BFP: Every year we partner with LendwithCare.org – your microlending initiative where people can provide loans to small entrepreneurs in developing countries. Access to finance seems to be a strong theme of CARE’s work – why is that? LL: I had been a lender with Lendwithcare.org for several years before I actually came to work for CARE and I do see it as a great way of supporting entrepreneurs and connecting people in the UK with the work that poor people are doing themselves every day to lift their families out of poverty. At CARE, we see that ensuring families have access to finance and to a wide range of financial services, can change their ability to both cope with shocks and with the problems that happen in life, and to grab the opportunities and fulfil their potential. A family is better able to get health care when it needs it, is better able to pay for schooling where that&#8217;s not free, and better able to invest in farming or other entrepreneurial activities. Access to finance is something that can touch every aspect of a family’s life. BFP: Before becoming the CEO of CARE International UK, you were Africa Director at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and prior to that head of International Trade at the UK’s Department for International Development, and before that adviser to the UK Prime Minister on development. Tell us a bit more about your personal journey, and what insights you picked up along the way that you will bring to your new role. LL: I am excited about being CEO at CARE. It is an opportunity to look at different aspects of development work. I am looking forward to a job that brings me closer to implementation on the ground – something I did when I ran programmes in Afghanistan and South Africa for the British Government. At the same time, I’m looking forward to drawing on the experience I had working on trade negotiations, working with Tony Blair on the 2005 G8 summit, and on policy issues in Africa for the Gates Foundation – to make sure that CARE has a bigger impact than just the work that we ourselves can implement on the ground, by engaging in policy discussions at the national and global level. Having worked for a few different organisations, makes you realise that no one organization gets everything right and that no one organisation can achieve a big objective in development on their own. I think there are some great things that CARE is doing but there are some things that we can learn from others. And I have a big interest in making sure that we build partnerships with business and with the rest of the NGO sector, civil society, academia and the media. BFP: The world is full of bad news right now – with conflict in the Middle East and Ebola in West Africa. Take any of these daunting challenges, and they seem too big for any one organisation to tackle alone. How can we work together to have the systemic, large-scale impact needed? LL: I am really proud of the humanitarian work that CARE does. In the Philippines we responded with a focus on shelter – one of our areas of expertise. We are working with communities in several of the countries neighbouring Syria, receiving refugees and making sure that their various needs are looked after. And we are partnering with the DEC Appeal on the horrendous situation in Gaza. There is a well-established approach among NGOs to partnering and complementing each other in a division of labour in a humanitarian space, and CARE focuses in particular on shelter, as well as water, sanitation and sexual and reproductive health. In our business partnerships, we often also partner with other NGOs – sometimes to extend the scale of the partnership or to bring in complementary skills. Of course, to have the biggest, most lasting change, requires us to work across the whole system. That might be about improving employment conditions in the clothing industry, or the way farmers are included in the supply chains in the cocoa industry, or the way – as I mentioned earlier – banks bring low-income customers into the formal sector. This requires engaging all the major players in those sectors – businesses, regulators, civil society. Our aim is to try and ensure that the changes and the approaches that we test out with companies, set new standards and can influence the standards of a sector as a whole. BFP: Finally, can you share with us what you see as CARE’s priorities for the next 12 months, and how partnerships with organisations like Business Fights Poverty can play a role? LL: Our mission is to end poverty and injustice and in the poor parts of the world. We are working towards that both through implementing programmes directly on the ground and by trying to achieve more systemic change through influencing the policy of companies and governments. Obviously I am new in the role &#8211; I’ve been here less than two weeks &#8211; and so I am still really at the point of assessing the work that we are doing and how it can improve, and the biggest opportunities and challenges for CARE in the years ahead. But there is no doubt that we see partnership with businesses as a key part of our vision going forward. I think that Business Fights Poverty plays a great role in encouraging people to think about the relationship between business and development and the role that different sectors can play. Business Fights Poverty provides a space for that conversation to be had and hopefully you can carry on encouraging people to think of new ways to engage business, new problems that business has a role in addressing, and knew business opportunities which can have a positive social impact. I think that’s a good role for you to play and hopefully a role we can also contribute to.",2014-09-02 11:47:21,Podcasts,Text,,✅,,Progress:,99.5%,,,,uploaded,,Progress,99.50%,100.00%
23910,Keith Weed,https://businessfightspoverty.org/keith-weed,"Last week, Yvette Torres-Rahman, Partnerships Director at Business Fights Poverty, interviewed Keith Weed, Chief Marketing and Communications Officer at Unilever. Keith spoke about the issues they aim to raise awareness for through the Unilever Sustainable Living Young Entrepreneurs Awards, and what the business case was for launching the Awards back in 2013. Keith also talked about how Unilever is placing sustainability at the core of its business. This year&#8217;s winner of the Award is Daniel Yu, founder of ReliefWatch. His project is helping health workers manage medicine inventory records via mobile technology. Daniel and other entrepreneurs are inspiring Unilever employees to be more entrepreneurial and to find innovative ways to put sustainability at the core of their business. The scale of some of the problems Unilever is tackling such as deforestation and WASH are enormous, and the message for other Business Fights Poverty members is that business needs to work with civil society and government to make a meaningful impact at scale.

SteamaCo is a Kenyan company working to provide affordable, pre-paid power to rural customers. Hear from Sam how they are fulfilling the unmet needs in the energy access space. One example he speaks about is a microgrid. Essentially this is a solar energy vending machine set up in remote villages. Users buy small units of power upfront using their mobile phones. They also provide mechanisms for bridge financing, remote management and data that de-risks investment. He discusses how they aim to use their energy vending machine concept also for grid extensions e.g. in Kenya power lines cross villages where no-one is connected because they cannot afford the 500 USD connection. De facto, their system would become a financing mechanism to give last mile access to energy. Hear about SteamaCo plans for scaling up their business – including a “business in a box” proposition.

ANDE has just launched an Impact Report on the state of the small and growing business sector which can be downloaded by clicking here. One of the key challenges highlighted in the report is how to recruit and retain talent in the Small &amp; Growing Business (SGB) sector. In response, ANDE members are convening in multiple regions to build the sector’s collective capacity to attract top talent that will enter and stay in the sector. On Business Fights Poverty, members have shared many examples of how SGBs are providing access to health care, offering smallholder farmers better income opportunities, and connecting isolated off-grid communities to new energy sources, amongst other examples of positive social impact. ANDE’s report has also found that SGBs are an important way of addressing development goals. Hear Genevieve’s perspective on how we can convince more donors and investors that SGBs are an effective means of delivering development services. An interesting observation is that the popularity of accelerator models for capacity development has grown enormously in recent times. While financial support has increased for these programs, measurement of their effectiveness has not kept pace.

24821,Dulce Alejandre,https://businessfightspoverty.org/dulce-alejandre,"This week Yvette Torres-Rahman, Parterships Director at Business Fights Poverty, interviews Dulce Alejandre, Inclusive Business Manager for CEMEX. Hear how CEMEX’s Integral Program of Assisted Auto Construction (PIAC) is helping poor families build their homes and how the Self-Employment Productive Centers which are profit making micro-businesses are helping make the initiative self-sustaining. Dulce explains how PIAC is changing whole communities by empowering people both in a financial sense, creating assets they can leverage and in a psicological sense by increasing people’s self esteem. CEMEX is keen to promote this close involvement with these end users as it helps them better understand how to innovate and improve their products for lower income groups. One such innovation, brought to market thanks to a partnership with lodal entrepreneurs and an NGO, is an efficient cookstove. Hear the original interview in Spanish by clicking on the image above or read the full transcript of the interview translated into English below. _____________________________________________ YVETTE TORRES-RAHMAN: Today I’d like to welcome Dulce Alejandre, CEMEX’s Inclusive Business Manager. Good morning Dulce, how are you? DULCE ALEJANDRE: Hello Yvette, how are you? YTR: I am doing very well, thank you. Here, at Business Fights Poverty, it has come to our attention CEMEX’s Integral Program of Assisted Auto Construction (PIAC). I understand that CEMEX helps low-income families by providing them access to housing to help improve their quality of life. Dulce, tell me what other challenges PIAC is trying to address and what makes PIAC unique? DA: Yvette, I am very happy to have this opportunity to talk with you this morning. The truth is that – for us – PIAC is a social business model that, as you have very well introduced, targets families with housing needs. Having started to work within the community, with social groups that have this problem, makes us understand not only what the reality of these people is but also to view it from a more holistic view point, their families, and [helps us understand] who these urban population groups are. One of our most relevant challenges is how we can – starting from an initiative that influences the housing aspect – generate a transformation of a whole community or of a specific urban group. We require more integral interventions. Obviously, for us, as a business, part of PIAC’s achievements is to articulate an ecosystem made up of different entrepreneurs, government institutions and universities that also are very active in the development area. Particularly, PIAC has transformed itself into a tool that describes an ecosystem [and can be used] to intervene in these urban population groups. It has been very interesting how starting from an initiative directly targeting the housing aspect, we have been able to implement new education schemes, new power and energy schemes, new water collection systems, all around the idea of empowering and transforming the community. The challenges of this model are very big, since, in Mexico, more than 11 million families live in extreme poverty. Also, their geographic locations represent difficulties. We have families where we would like to intervine, but they are located in high risk areas. These areas are very vulnerable to natural disastres and, precisely, PIAC’s mission to bring together these ecosystems has enabled us to work with an integral approach towards the community. In such cases, we have been able to relocate the families to safe areas, providing them with legal documents stating ownership of assets. What has happened once we have had the families in a process whereby they have already improved their housing situation? We run into families that feel really empowered and, obviously, counting on these assets they get included into the financial system. Nevertheless, one of the most relevent topics for us, at PIAC, is the aggregation of actors, with different expertise, that makes it possible to turn the intervention in these groups into an integral reality. What is one of the challenges? Obviously, one of our challenges is to translate these alliances into convincing actions or community transformation actions, making our way of interacting with the communities more strategic and this has also enabled us to build meaningful alliances with the organization. Why? Because we take all these collaborative issues to specific development actions. YTR: Dulce, you have mentioned that PIAC empowers people. I also believe you have created Self-Employment Productive Centers (SEPCs) that, as far as I understand, help on the empowerment front. But how have you managed to make these centers self-sustaining? DA: Exactly, the Self-Employment Productive Centers are key to the integral support models we implement in the community. SEPC allows you to start working with the communities. What we do is, through an alliance with the community we will work in, we open a center to give access to technology and training so people can start organizing themsleves and learn how to assist in the production of basic [construction] materials to implement improvements in their houses or in public areas of their community. What has been key in this self-employment model? The collaborative work. I believe most of the achievements we obtain are about citizen participation. The SEPCs incentivise people to organize themsleves in groups of 10 to 20 families that get together to organize the production [of their materials]. And above all, this has enabled people – regardeless of their education level – to easily (supported with technical and psychosocial assistance provided by us) see the results of their work by implementing a practical education system. Once we provide them with building abilities and technical knowledge, people – in these centers – realize they have the ability and strength and also have other capabilities that were just “there”, that they simply had to dedicate time and discipline and work to see how their actions can be reflected in having a better house, a better community, a better park. So, these SEPCs, generally, help us in having them interacting among themselves, getting to know each other, setting their targets and wishes. For us, the SEPCs are the first means to start interacting with the community, to get to know them, their habits, their priorities. This allows us, CEMEX, to understand what the best dynamic is to set processes and productive cycles. But the most relevant benefit for us is to help us bring out innovation. Since there is a lot of union and contact with the community, we understand better how to innovate and improve our products and services for these groups. Each center has different dynamics, as each group is completely different. This allows us to customize our actions to suit the specific needs the group has. YTR: Tell me Dulce, are these SEPCs profitable? DA: Yes, the SEPCs operate as a social business. Each SEPC generates a production of prefabricated materials; 50% of the production remains in the community and the other 50% is commercialized by CEMEX and its partners or through its distribution network. The 50% we sell allows us to reinvest in materials what we obtain, so to maintain the operation of the SEPC. This 50% that is commercialized allows this model to be sustainable and will continue as long as the community needs it. We have production centers that last between 1 and 5 years. We even have some centers that were initially set up, after agreement with local authorities, to last for 2 years, and after these 2 years the same community requested to keep the center as a community venture, as a sort of micro business. Given this reality, we have been evaluating setting up a micro franchise model so this SEPC remains to satisfy the demand, remaining as a source of employment in the community. The fact that we have decided to work with initiatives that are focused on construction has made this model not only deliver a social profit but also value towards the business, since we operate the productive centers through alliances with other commercial sectors. What does this mean? That through the productive centers we generate incremental sales, we strengthen our distribution network, we make them get closer to markets they had not explored, the low-income markets. Obviously, when we approach the distribution networks and introduce these new models, they get a better understanding of this segment so they can provide a better service towards them. They understand this segment might need different payment terms, credit and/or financial conditions based on the income these people have. The fact that these Productive Centers are linked to our distribution network and that they are also linked to the main business of our corporation makes this an initiative that generates great value to our company, mainly for three reasons: &#8211; Proximity to new markets &#8211; Development of new markets &#8211; Strategic relationships with interest groups, such as neighboring communities, governments, universities, architect and civil engineer centers, our distribuitors. To be able to interact with these interest groups through this initiative has been very important, because, in the end, it generates value for us, in terms of growth and reputation. YTR: And based on this, what ideas have you come up with related to private-public partnerships? DA: This has been something really interesting. We have innovated with new social business models. In fact, a year ago, we implemented a new business, we designed a concrete ecological cookstove, which targets a specific group of people, mainly rural groups, families that cook with firewood and face health problems caused by cooking with wood in their homes. In order to be able to get this product to reach this specific rural group, we did it through an alliance with an NGO and different entrepreneurs that work in rural communities. This allowed us, from our Technology Center of Cement and Concrete, to innovate in econotecnology, in a more efficient cookstove so we could generate more impact, reducing CO2 emissions and making it more efficient, with lower consumption of wood. We launched this new technology last year. Currently, the challenge we have is to reach more than 5,000 families with ecological cookstoves. We have a cookstove production plant in San Luis, Potosí, we have another plant in Guatemala and we continue innovating, since – along the way – we have run into new entrepreneurs working with technology for rainwater collection that also use our products. This has allowed us, a part from creating these innovation schemes that make us count on new ways to serve the community, to have a better understanding and get closer to our clients, our end conusmers. This is relevant as it enables us to implement improvements related to services and competitivity. I believe the fact that CEMEX has opened this door and its coexistence and collective work channels – through the SEPCs and PIAC – brings us very close to people, to find out what our distribution network needs to be succesfull, enabling us – at the same time – to innnovate in our service processes. With respect to the authorities, I believe that being in such a close relationship with them makes us see what challenges the government has, such us urban issues, inclusion issues and poverty issues. We understand that building working teams with universities and the private sector we can complement each other. It is much easier facing a challenge when you have three participating actors: alliances between government, private businesses and community are very powerfull. YTR: We have also found that alliances among those three entities are very powerfull. Thank you Dulce for this interview. I wish you the best with PIAC and all these innovations you have talked to me about today. DA: I thank you Yvette. It has been a pleasure to be able to share and to be part of the community that brings more alliances to work for these communities. To me, it would be very valuable that those who are listening to us reach out to us and help build a better world, to strengthen their initiatives, to strengthen what we are doing, but above all to help more families live in better conditions. YTR: Thank you Dulce. I hope they hear what you have said and get in touch with you.

In 2015, EthioChicken formed a skills partnership with EY Enterprise Growth Services (EGS), a not-for-profit, not-for-loss “social enterprise inside EY,” the global tax, audit, and consulting firm. Hear how these two companies came into contact with each other through Acumen and how EY helped EthioChicken identify a wide range of operational and financial performance improvements, and prioritize which ones to take on after the engagement. EY also helped the social enterprise select an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system, an important strategic investment decision for any small business. EY’s learnings include simplifying and stripping down their standard approach to software development and managing expectations around timing horizons for Small companies bearing in mind their more limited resources compared to larger multinationals. EthoiChicken’s positive experience of the partnership has been enhanced by the fact that their senior team have been actively engaged in the process. Acumen and Business Fights Poverty recently released a report about collaboration between social enterprises and global corporations, which describes the kind of work EhtioChicken and EY have done together as a “skills partnership.” Collaboration can be tricky, EY’s advice to other multinationals considering engaging with smaller social enterprises is to be true to the core of your business so the partnership becomes a natural extension of your business.",2015-10-30 17:09:35,Podcasts,Audio,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hzkDPEqgNihQuFWNx1olCz97B38gbS4j/view?usp=drive_link,✅,,,,,,,uploaded,uploaded,,,

402084,Careen Abb,https://businessfightspoverty.org/careen-abb,"During this podcast, Careen explains why addressing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and their large financing gap, requires an impact analysis implementation framework to be applied up front. Careen highlights how a holistic approach to impact analysis, i.e. understanding both positive and negative effects, across the three pillars of sustainable development (social, environmental and economic), could not only help us to collectively develop new solutions to achieve the SDGs, but also reduce the costs involved in their delivery. With many organisations already mapping back their societal impacts to the SDGs during reporting season, Careen and her team are now creating useful tools to conduct impact analysis that can be applied ahead of programme or proposition delivery. Developed via the UN Environmental Programme’s Finance Initiative (UNEP FI) – the Positive Impact Initiative already has signatories that include financial organisations such as: ABN-AMRO, Aviva, BNP Paribas, ING Bank, Hermes Investment Management, Societe Generale, Triodos Bank and many others. Now Careen is on a mission to engage organisations from other sectors. As she says: ‘Only by working collaboratively will the Global Goals be achieved.’ At a time when many are calling for consolidation across the impact management space, with The Impact Management Project and The Corporate Reporting Dialogue amongst others exploring the topic – Positive Impact could also be an ideal way to deliver this consolidation and provide consistency – for businesses, financiers, investors and impact specialists. If your organisation is interested to know more about how the analysis and measurement of its positive and negative societal impacts could help deliver business and social value, then we would love to hear from you. Simply contact me directly on Ka***@bu*******************.org More can be found on the Positive Impact Initiative here. In addition look out for Rethinking Impact to Finance the SDGs, a new positioning paper and call to action launching at the UNEP FI Global Roundtable in Paris on 26-28 November 2018, where Careen and her team will also be launching a set of tools for holistic impact analysis including a model framework for various financial instrument and asset classes, and the accompanying Radar tool.",2018-11-27 11:01:58,Podcasts,Audio,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XWsrwl5lyXepX8l3Ht8vp7pw6xYhwoAE/view?usp=drive_link,✅,,,,,,,uploaded,uploaded,,,

Prathyusha Parakala, Hydrabad millennial, radio DJ and climate ambassador, joins us to share her first-hand experiences – about the wave of social and environmental actions sweeping across India. To provide some background: in 2014 India became the first nation to make it mandatory for all companies with a net worth over US $70 million to spend a minimum of two percent of their average three year net profits on CSR. This sits alongside the ‘extended producer responsibility’ or EPR – where sellers of plastic and e-waste have a responsibility for collecting and recycling it. Both of these laws have since been tightened, with fines and possible imprisonment for non-compliance with the former and tighter monitoring and targets for the latter.

During this interview Professor Mayer explores the Principles of Purposeful Business, the report he has recently worked on with the British Academy. Professor Mayer takes listeners on a journey of how leading academics have moved from thinking of a business’ sole purpose being to maximise the returns for its shareholders towards a model where a business must take into account multiple stakeholder considerations. Professor Mayer’s explains: “Business is really there to solve problems profitably – to provide profitable solutions to people or the plant’s problems. But not to profit from producing problems for people or planet.” Listen to this podcast for your own mini MBA module into purposeful business.

403390,Paul Skinner,https://businessfightspoverty.org/paul-skinner,"Paul eloquently explains why the paradigm of competitive advantage in the world of business may be blinding us and holding back business success. He advocates for human purpose and our innate desire to collaborate to get the most out of our businesses – delivering collaborative advantage. “Competitive advantage can most hold us back when we aren’t thinking about it. It has infiltrated our core assumptions. So, we need to actively overcome these cognitive biases. We need to ask new questions – not – what do we do best, but how do we enable people and the world to do better.” Explains Paul. Paul challenges us around future trends that should be on our agenda. He suggests that the question should be “what is missing?” He views an absence of understanding that profits are not always created equally as dangerous. If money is generated at the expense of people or planet, they shouldn&#8217;t be valued so highly. He highlights the opportunity for SMEs to deliver societal impact and would like to see MBA courses teaching the learnings from charities and social enterprises.

As Alice explains: “Sadly COVID-19 is exacerbating gender inequality.” Prior to the pandemic evidence shows that one in three women experience gender-based violence. During the lockdown the estimates are that globally there is a 20% increase in that number. Jane and Alice not only address this difficult subject head on during our podcast conversation, but they share their practical insight from years working on the issue. They explain why in 2019 the ILO convention 190 raised the important question of duty of care of businesses on their employees. Recognising that not only workplace harassment but also that businesses are affected by and have a duty of care when violence takes place in the home. With so many people working remotely, from home due to the COVID-19 global pandemic, this convention has become so much more important and many businesses are stepping up to address domestic violence and support their employees. “And what we are seeing is that businesses aren’t just thinking about how to support survivors. But more and more businesses are working on ways to address the perpetrators.” Explains Jane. “We want to stop the perpetration of abuse. We have to look at this in relation to men and boys and prevention in the long term.” And what are their recommendations: “We would want to see all businesses implementing policies and procedures, for prevention and resolution. To build spaces for women to talk and to build trust.” To hear more detail of Jane and Alice’s advice, please do take a listen.

COVID-19 has placed huge pressures on an already faltering global health system. This is leaving many millions of people vulnerable to illness and further impeding their abilities to lead fulfilling and prosperous lives. “In the wake of COVID it has become apparent that access to self-care needs to be a key solution when we think about health care and the health care continuum,” Daniella says. Before examining why virtual tele-health solutions, health ownership and better pharmaceutical services are vital trends we need to see more of, if we want to be healthier, and alleviate pressures on our health care systems.

It ranks countries based on children’s exposure to climate and environmental shocks, such as cyclones and heatwaves, as well as their vulnerability to those shocks, based on their access to essential services. The tool helps you to prioritize action for those most at risk. My guests in this podcast are Maria Pia Bianchetti, Senior Specialist, Child Rights and Business, at the UK Committee for UNICEF and Nicholas Rees, Climate and Environment Specialist, at UNICEF. During our conversation Maria-Pia and Nick share insight and data from this new index. Revealing that “More than 1/3 of children globally are exposed to four or more (severe environmental hazard).” Whilst suggesting practical ways all of us, and in particular businesses, can take action that could reduce children’s vulnerability to climate change and environmental shocks. Nick and Maria Pia talk passionately about why “every child has the right to a healthy environment.” Advocating strongly that we need to put people, and in particular children, at the heart of our climate action.

405724,How cooperatives benefit smallholder farmers with Hileena Eshetu and Mark Blackett,https://businessfightspoverty.org/hileena-eshetu-and-mark-blackett,"Hileena Eshetu and Mark Blackett from Agribusiness Market Ecosystem Alliance AMEA explain how cooperatives benefit smallholder farmers. There are an estimated 525 million smallholder farmers globally – producing one third of the world’s food. Helping farmers and agribusinesses to be as professional as possible could increase incomes, create resilience to shocks and provide access pathways for smallholder famers to bigger business supply chains. Forming cooperatives can be a successful way to help make this happen. Mark Blackett and Hileena Eshetu, from Agribusiness Market Ecosystem Alliance (AMEA), share insights into what makes up successful agribusiness alliances, how cooperatives benefit smallholder farmers, before delving into the difficulties all involved have in ensuring their success and sustainability. Be ready for practical ways to scale and support smallholder farmers and supply chains alike. Mark is AMEA’s Network Director whilst Hileena is their Ethiopia Regional Network Facilitator. During this conversation Mark advocates for better collaboration between agribusinesses, finance, NGOs and the public sector – sharing practical examples and advice for successful, sustainable agribusiness. Hileena in turn advocates that “AMEA exists because the current approaches [to smallholder farmer cooperatives] are very fragmented; Bringing everyone together and formulating solutions collectively must be the way forward.” Together they dive into what needs to be in place for smallholder farmers to become climate change resilient and suggest ways for agri-businesses of all sizes to build the fundamentals of climate preparedness.

But with care it can be done. Best selling author, social enterprise founder, CEO and social impact pioneer: Shawn Askinosie shares the true benefits of understanding your supply chain. Shawn setup Askinosie Chocolate 16 years ago with his daughter Lawren. They were recently named by Forbes “One of the 25 Best Small Companies in America.” and he’s been named by O, The Oprah Magazine, “One of 15 Guys Who Are Saving the World.” Shawn has an Amazon #1 bestselling book titled “Meaningful Work: The Quest To Do Great Business, Find Your Calling, and Feed Your Soul.” What can we learn from chocolate supply chains In this podcast Shawn joins us to talk about the benefits he gets of deeply knowing his chocolate supply chain. He sheds light on the challenges of building a sustainable chocolate supply chain. Shaw explains the rewards of deeply knowing who he working with, understanding the cocoa growers communities he&#8217;s working with and building a business with his daughter. Shawn is working hard to make globalisation work for him. After a successful legal career Shawn gave it all up to found a business with his daughter and focus on something he loves. This podcast provides practical insights into running a small business, the challenges the pandemic brought; and why now is the time for good cash flow management. He dives candidly into how his father’s death spurred an innate desire to “deep work.” Which triggered his abandonment of a 20 year legal career and paved the way to his true calling: chocolate. From working across his value chains, Shawn cites a key takeaway: “I aspire to continue to learn from [the farmers I work with] about this notion of ‘enough’ – how farmers demonstrate the joy of what seems so small.” To the big businesses, he says: “there is a way for your big business, to engage in the supply chain in a way that will change your life.” “If we&#8217;re not at the tip top levels asking how much is enough, then nothing will be enough. I think that we have runaway greed that forgets why we&#8217;re doing this, what our purpose is. And I&#8217;m fearful of this. But by the same token, I&#8217;m very optimistic for the future of capitalism, because I believe that we&#8217;re in the midst of a sea change.” Listen to the full podcast here.

This is something that requires action today.” Implores Swenja. As a contributing author to the IPCC, and the lead author of the UK&#8217;s Climate Change Risk Assessment, Swenja is aware of the horrifying statement embedded within the report “… that up to 3.6 billion people are highly vulnerable to climate change.” So, to make her impact on the world, she is Chair of the Munich Climate Insurance Initiative and Head of Adaptation Research at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment, part of the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE). If that wasn’t enough, Swenja is now taking up a new role as Managing Director Climate and Sustainability at Marsh McLennans and has been appointed by the UK Government to join the UK Committee on Climate Change &#8211; Adaptation Committee. And to top it all off, Swenja is a mother of four and all-round social impact hero. Listen to our conversation to determine if you too find it an awkward awakener as Swenja explains why the urgency of “understanding climate change as a threat multiplier.” Swenja goes on to provide practical ways for businesses and all organisations to embed climate risk properly across business decision-making in order to develop adaptation and resilience strategies. As a frequent collaborator with business and cities who are often managing multi risks and challenges, Swenja encourages cross pollination of risk skills within business practitioners. “Every sort of dollar invested now in adaptation, saves at least $5, in some cases, up to $10, or even more in costs that you avoid.” Swenja goes on to explain how we must overcome our inherent reactive natures to plan in and account for future climate impacts now. With an average of 86% of climate disaster money being spent after a disaster and only 14% preventatively, she concludes: “Being prepared and becoming more resilient should really be seen as an investment in our future.” Listen in to find out much more.

The ILO estimated that in 2019 there were 169 million international migrant workers in the world (accounts for approximately 4.9 per cent of the global labour force). If you are working abroad, travelling and away from home, you might be working in a foreign language, vulnerable to changes in currency, contracts and perhaps without a permanent home address. All reasons that could mean you aren’t able to get the training and development you need. If you’re in a business employing people from other locations – training and supporting your workers properly across language and cultural barriers is vital. Helping your workers in supply chains that cross borders – essential. Listen in to hear Aleksandra and Sandra share their leading thinking on how to best support migrant workers; what business need to do to adhere to the new EU directive on Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence; and why training doesn’t need to stop when workers have differing languages or low literacy. Aleksandra Lasota is the Migration, Business and Human Rights Lead at the International Organization for Migration (IOM) and based in Thailand. Her expertise lies in working with businesses to support them in upholding the rights of migrant workers in international supply chains; as well as broader migration and displacement issues in locations ranging across the Middle East, Asia and the Pacific. Sandra Granath is Head of Learning for Quizrr the digital training platform which focuses on helping people across boundaries and supply chains to learn.

Social impact pioneer, Anita Neville, helps us unpack this complex topic. This podcast forms part of a series &#8211; examining how business addresses climate justice. Together, we hear how businesses are working to put people at the heart of their climate action. Listen to this conversation to find out how one major agricultural business is working to remove deforestation from its business; where green washing and green hushing collide; and why supporting workers and farming communities, both big and small, is essential in creating a just transition in a low carbon future. Palm oil is a contentious topic. On the one hand its high yields and efficient land use provides a highly sustainable product vital to the global food chain as well as much needed income for small farmers in rural Indonesia. On the other, vast areas of tropical forest have been cleared to make way for palm plantations and these plantations are often monocultural.

407265,"Malnutrition is a Business Issue, Explain Maniza and Alok",https://businessfightspoverty.org/malnutrition-is-a-business-issue,"Why is Malnutrition a business issue? The link between malnutrition and poverty might be an obvious one. The links between malnutrition and business are perhaps less so. During this conversation we are going to deep dive into both, whilst looking at the intersections between nutrition, climate change, conflict and communicable disease. As the world braces for some of the most extreme food shortages seen in generations – we are going to talk hunger and malnutrition and why everyone, everywhere should be sitting up and engaging on this deeply sad topic. During this podcast hear from two of our world’s experts on childhood development and nutrition. Maniza Ntekim and Dr. Alok Ranjan. Maniza leads the Early Childhood Development East and Southern Africa initiative at the Conrad N. Hilton Foundation. Previously she’s served as a regional advisor for UNICEF’s Eastern and Southern Africa Regional Office, overseeing the early childhood development programmes. Alok is the Director of Programmes and Investments for The Power of Nutrition. He is a medical doctor with a post-graduate degree in Community Medicine. Prior to The Power of Nutrition, he led the Nutrition program at the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation for India, Bangladesh, Indonesia and South Asia. “What I have realised over my career is that we need to work across multiple levels of deprivation. Working in silos will not give us long term sustainable impact. The focus of Business Fights Poverty belief in the power of business to help in the lives, livelihoods and learning of those most vulnerable really resonates with The Power of Nutrition’s vision – where we feel every child must have the nutrition to reach their full potential.” Explains Alok. Together they warn about the world sleep walking into the global nutrition crisis and that every 60 seconds a child is becoming severely malnourished and almost 50 million people are hungry. They are determined that business needs to step up – that malnutrition is a business issue, without healthy people, businesses cannot succeed. Maniza expounds: “This is a not just a charity issue, it’s a matter of business survival. Businesses need skilled human capital to grow, to be competitive and to be productive. The basis of a good business is human capital. We know that human capital is developed in the early stages of life; 80% per cent of the human brain is developed by the age of three. If a significant proportion of the population within which you hire is poorly nourished and not had the chance to be developmentally on track that’s critical for your business.” Maniza and Alok are deeply practical and pragmatic in how we can collectively address malnutrition and hunger and what businesses in particular can do about it. Together they make the business case for investing in good food – from healthy workforces to higher cognitive performances.

According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), 70.8 million people have been forcibly displaced worldwide. Being a ‘forcibly displaced person’ or a ‘refugee’ are labels. What does it really take to rebuild your life in a new country? And how can businesses lean in and support people to get back on their feet, to get quality jobs and to support all our economies and communities as best they can? During this podcast you will meet Mohammad Yusuf. Yusuf shares with us his journey – from Syria to London. Yusuf is a software developer, who left Syria when the conflict escalated. Yusuf reached the UK and applied for asylum, sought refugee status and ‘the right to work’…this conversation examines how he rebuilt his life and how he found applying for a legal right to work. Yusuf explains: “One of the barriers I faced at first was the right to work. I didn&#8217;t have the right tools straightaway when I came to the UK. Being a refugee or asylum seeker makes getting a job very difficult. I didn’t have the local qualifications, I lacked the local connections and network, plus English isn’t my first language.” Alongside Yusuf, we also hear from Emily Johnson who is the Director of Europe Corporate Responsibility for Cummins, a global power leader that designs, manufactures and distributes power solutions. People working with Cummins started volunteering at workshops with Breaking Barriers &#8211; a charity who supports refugees into meaningful employment. Emily explains how they partnered with Breaking Barriers to develop a sustained refugee employability programme. Emily explains: “We know that people from refugee backgrounds have faced tremendous challenges and bring skills, experience and wisdom that can make our communities and our business stronger and more resilient. We believe that we have a role to play in helping to improve the situation for refugees in our communities. We know we are not the experts, so we seek to partner with non-profits that have deep expertise and understanding of the needs of refugees in our communities.

407367,"Food Security and Climate Change, with Aled Jones, NFU Cymru",https://businessfightspoverty.org/food-security-and-climate-change,"Planting trees can cause social harm. The simplest solutions are so often the best ones, but not always. Take climate change – we have put too much carbon into the atmosphere. The planet’s main mechanism to take carbon from the atmosphere is trees – so the solution to climate change is tree planting. Right?! Not necessarily, if it means families lose their homes and food is taken out of production. This podcast unpacks the complexities of food security and climate change &#8211; their interwoven dependancies and knock on affects to poverty. Hear from Social Impact Pioneer Aled Jones. Aled is an eighth-generation farmer and the President of the National Farmers Union Cymru &#8211; the leading agricultural organisation that represents and champions all farmers and growers in Wales. Listen to this podcast as Aled shares his wisdom – he carefully picks apart deeply complicated systemic challenges and their knock-on effects – covering topics ranging across land management, agriculture, food supply, nourishing people and climate change. He explains why tackling food waste should be a priority and how upweighting the importance of agriculture and food systems in our political decision making will ensure better long-term outcomes in food supply, nutrition, climate action and helping to lift people out of poverty. Aled says: “We are now seeing food and energy being weaponised and I fear water can be a critical weapon and all will impact social stability.” Aled is a champion for ordinary people to be at the decision-making table. He implores us all to step up and be heard. Aled explains why experience and wisdom from all walks of life must be brought together if we are to find solutions that will genuinely benefit all. This is no black and white conversation of easy answers – but as Aled says: “There is a much, much, much larger picture…but we all have a responsibility.” Links: Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2021 World Health Organisation – Healthy Diet, 2020 NFU Cymru, Growing Together 2022 Oxfam, Tightening the net, 2021 NFU Cymru World Farmers Association If you liked this podcast, try: Regenerative farming and climate change, with Patrick Nyaga, Farm Africa",2022-12-14 13:52:57,Podcasts,Audio,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GA5w21K0_U9VkFCn0o9Oc4RK4CVa2ypt/view?usp=drive_link,✅,,,,,,,uploaded,uploaded,,,
407957,"NGO Advocacy with Chelsea Hodgkins, Oxfam America",https://businessfightspoverty.org/ngo-advocacy,"How can civil society hold businesses and governments to account? This podcast examines the role of NGO advocacy and activism in pushing for better social and environmental outcomes. Chelsea Hodgkins is a Policy Advisor on Oxfam America’s Climate, Energy, and Extractive Industries team. She joins us for this conversation having recently been to the climate conference, COP27 in Egypt. During this podcast Chelsea looks specifically at the role of different sectors and how the freedom of speech is essential to improve energy security and access, before providing practical advice on how to deliver a ‘just transition’ and why the Loss and Damage Fund is an important ray of hope. Chelsea implores us: “Movements really matter.” With Chelsea’s expertise in extractives and energy – she talks in detail about the differing forms of energy; how governments and businesses are pursuing their climate policies – sometimes to the detriment of vulnerable people and the climate; whilst demanding more investment be made in renewable energy sources across the world. Chelsea talks frankly on the question: “How can our energy transition respect human rights?” Chelsea cites the “dramatic increase in demand for minerals used for solar panels, electric vehicles and battery storage” is a key area we need to ensure vulnerable and Indigenous People are not forgotten during the rush to mine critical minerals in the clean energy transition. This podcast conversation is not necessarily an easy listen. Chelsea holds us all to account. But her pragmatic advice for business practitioners and policy makers means that it is a must listen to if we are to ensure no-one is left behind during the transition to a clean economy.

Social Impact Pioneer and climate activist Pushpanath Krishnamurthy talks about what motivates and drives him to give up an easy life and devote it to campaigning for climate justice. Push to his friends has in the past 11 years walked over 35 million steps in the name of climate action. And in the process, he has walked with and listening to over 600,000 people. Push began his walking in 2009 when he set off from Oxford to walk to Copenhagen. In this conversation Push shares some of the stories from people he has met along the way. He paints a vivid picture of what climate change looks like in remote villages in Uganda and how people are innovating climate resilient solutions. Push is a passionate believer in better understanding everyone’s perspectives. He says: “It is the darkest paradox of our times that those who caused so little to the climate crisis have paid with life and livelihood, and yet they are able to show us, with just a little power and voice &#8211; a clear way forward to adapt and mitigate as well as deliver Justice.” In addition, Push is a master in connecting the dots. Across his travels he has met so many people. You will hear a masterclass of how a connector and master networker connects ideas with entrepreneurs, farming cooperatives with big business supply chains, and policymakers with community builders.

410482,Gender Parity in Farming with Taryn and Emily,https://businessfightspoverty.org/gender-parity-in-farming,"Gender parity in farming and equality for women in agriculture could feed millions more around the world. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations estimate that closing the gender gap in agricultural inputs alone could lift 100–150 million people out of hunger. This podcast hears from Social Impact Pioneers: Emily Janoch from the NGO CARE and Taryn Barclay from multi-national company Cargill. Together they talk deeply about why women are critical to prosperous food supply chains, what difference it would make if we take women seriously in the agricultural sector and how supporting women and their communities is essential for long term sustainability. Spoiler alert: “When women have more access, control and ownership over their businesses – they deliver incredible success and impact for themselves, their families and their communities.” Explains Taryn. NGOs and corporates often partner but not many partnerships run for so long or as deeply as the partnership between Cargill and CARE. Cargill connects farmers with markets, customers with ingredients and families with daily essentials. Whilst CARE started with a simple emergency relief package, delivered over seven decades ago. Cargill and CARE’s relationship stretches back to 1958 when Cargill contributed to ‘Care’s food crusade.’ Today, Cargill and CARE launch a new phase of the latest iteration of their partnership as they continue to work in developing gender parity in farming businesses and agricultural communities. Prepare to hear an open and honest discussion about what it takes to make partnerships really work as Taryn and Emily discuss how they could make their partnership even better. A little on Emily and Taryn: Emily Janoch is the Senior Director for Thought Leadership and Knowledge Management and Learning at CARE.

411022,Gender Equity Pathways at work with Rani from IFC and Tere of Circle de Luz,https://businessfightspoverty.org/what-does-it-take-to-create-gender-equality-at-work,"What does it take to create gender equality at work? How can we help marginalised groups progress in business – and particularly marginalised women in business? Listen to this podcast to hear from Social Impact Pioneers helping young women from underserved backgrounds to progress and succeed in the workplace. Your gender, your education, your background, and your earning potential are all connected. If we’re going to create gender equality in the workplace, we need to understand that not all women have the same background, privileges, and experience. A woman’s earning potential goes up 20% for every year of schooling she completes. And sadly, girls are less likely to complete school than boys. Meet Social Impact Pioneers: Rani Pooran and Tere Gonzalez. They are champions of women in the workplace. Working tirelessly to create gender parity in education and in business. Together they talk in practical terms, about what we can do to help girls, particularly from marginalised backgrounds to succeed, prosper and reach their potential. They share practical ways for individuals and employers to take positive action. Rani Pooran is the Head of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion at the International Finance Corporation (IFC), part of the World Bank Group. Now based in Washington DC, Rani has worked in the UK, US and Canada. She is a past Chair of the United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative’s Gender Equality Working Group and a former board member and Vice-President of a community mental health agency based in Toronto. Tere, is the Executive Director of Circle de Luz. The Charlotte based organisation empowering young Latinas through extensive mentoring, holistic programming and scholarship funds for further education. She was appointed as one of the first 17 United Nations Young Leaders for the Sustainable Development Goals in recognition of her work around the world. Tere has previously worked at the United Nations Foundation, the Organization of American States, and the World Bank Group to advance shared prosperity, youth empowerment, gender equality, diversity, and the upward mobility of underserved groups. She is now the leader of Circle de Luz. Tere says: “I am a proud immigrant from Mexico and leader of a US based organisation empowering young Latinas and advancing their education. I believe education is one of the greatest assets a person can have—with a ripple effect on communities, economies, and the next generations.” And we would love to hear your thoughts on this conversation and urge you to join in the collection of better data to help everyone to be able to get on and achieve their potential.

411833,What&#8217;s it Really Going to Take to Reach Gender Equality?,https://businessfightspoverty.org/whats-it-really-going-to-take-to-reach-gender-equality,"Listen in to explore the challenges and opportunities surrounding gender equality and women’s empowerment. The conversation goes beyond the standard gender equality rhetoric: the importance of increasing women’s representation in leadership roles; encouraging gender-specific mentorship and skill development; promoting and supporting women. This conversation gets deeper, peering into some uncomfortable areas of why gender equality is in some cases stalling or reversing. During this conversation, you will hear men frankly explain why we need to put men into the driving seat of gender equality activities. How for many men there is no gender inequality problem. As Daniele Fiandaca, Co-Founder of Token Man explains: “It is impossible to effect change without the engagement of the majority.” In addition, this podcast challenges the cultural norms around caregiving and work. You will hear open and frank conversations around the guilt mothers and care givers have when trying to balance their wish and need to work. How creating positive narratives for children explaining why mummy is going to work is required if we wish to break the cycle of family derived resentment towards work. No one presumes to get it right, but we hear from mothers determined to be positive role models for their children. This podcast hears from Social Impact Pioneers: Jean Claude Niyomugabo, Co-Founder, Speke Farms; Daniele Fiandaca, Co-Founder, Token Man; Tashmia Ismail-Saville, Chief Business Development Officer, Mitacs; Ajaita Shah, Founder &amp; CEO, Frontier Markets Moderator: Katie Hyson, Director of Thought Leadership and COO, Business Fights Poverty This podcast was originally recorded as a live Twitter Space within the Business Fights Poverty Gender Summit 2023.

Instead, Donna then switched to helping entrepreneurs in emerging markets be more successful and scale their business. This year Donna has been recognised for her work across these two spaces – winning the Humanitarian Award for Service to the Science of Food in honour of Elizabeth Fleming Stie. These seem two very divergent careers but as Donna explains during this conversation they are truly linked. As Donna explains: “I am passionate about the importance of food science in food security&#8230; I realised that I had accumulated a lot of business experience over the years, and I can either die with it in my head, or I can share it with those who most need it.” Having spent decades working in multinational food businesses, Donna is the Chief Entrepreneurship Officer for EFour Enterprises– utilising finance, information systems, and business advisory for specialized enterprise support – particularly for food businesses in emerging markets. Donna’s multi-career journey has at the heart of it – solving the biggest problems, leaning into them, and bringing her skills and expertise as a scientist, technologist, business leader and coach. Listen in to learn how to increase food safety and decrease food loss and waste. How simple processing such as drying and canning could extend shelf life and reduce the food poverty and lean times for many around the world. Donna shares: “No one was utilising food science or food processing to alleviate food insecurity.” Donna&#8217;s approach is special &#8211; instead of simply pointing out the simplicity of the problem and solutions, she rolls up her sleeves and works directly with food entrepreneurs in emerging markets. Her mission is to share her business experience and knowledge with those who most need it. Listen in to hear Donna generously leaning in to share her top tips on getting businesses to stability and scalability.

With the EU laying down rules for companies to respect human rights and the environment in global value chains – how can businesses do this in practice? Social Impact Pioneers Sue Maslow, Patrick Miller and Olivia Windham Stewart are part of the Responsible Contracting Project &#8211; collaborating across industries, communities to tackle the challenge of embedding human rights protections into international supply chain contracts. If you are wondering how to act on the EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) or looking to protect your business from breaches in your supply chains, this podcast is for you. The concept of popping a few lines on human rights due diligence into a supplier contract seems like a simple idea – but the devil is in the detail. Contract law is complex, time-consuming and expensive if done badly. Contracts that exert unreasonable commercial pressure or place unrealistic expectations on suppliers don’t help anyone. During this conversation, Sue, Patrick and Olivia explain how templates of internationally recognised human rights due diligence principles have been developed to help businesses and those in procurement.

418344,"Financial Inclusion for Displaced People, with Micol, UNHCR and Ricardo, IFC",https://businessfightspoverty.org/financial-inclusion-for-displaced-people-with-micol-unhcr-and-ricardo-ifc,"Why is financial inclusion for displaced people a problem? If you are a migrant or a refugee, if you have left your home due to forced reasons, and you arrive in another country, chances are that financial services are not accessible to you. The lack of an ID card or the lack of recognition of the ID card provided to you is a barrier; the lack of your credit history and collateral are additional barriers; language differences and stereotypes; as well as the lack of information from financial service providers will all hold you back from getting access to financial services. And the consequences are that you may not be able to get a job, pay your taxes or set up your own enterprise. And yet, as we will hear in this podcast, improving financial services for displaced people, unlocks a wealth of economic and social growth for this population, as well as benefits and gains for the countries that hosts them. Meet Social Impact Pioneers Micol Pistelli and Ricardo Martin Garcia Tafur who have been working tirelessly to develop better financial service models for forcibly displaced people. Financial services that help migrants, refugees, and asylum seekers, as well as internal displaced people to get contributing to their local host communities and economies. Micol is a Senior Financial Inclusion Coordinator at UNHCR, The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees – which has the mandate to help and protect refugees, forcibly displaced communities, and stateless people around the world. Whilst Ricardo is a Senior Operations Officer at the IFC and UNHCR Joint Initiative that fosters private sector engagement into forced displacement contexts at the International Finance Corporation (the IFC) which is part of the World Bank Group. Both are deeply focused on building financial and economic inclusion of forcibly displaced populations. During this podcast conversation Micol and Ricardo roll up the blind on the economic case for having better financially integrated people in host communities. They explain: “If people migrating into your area are economically contributing to your area, paying their taxes and putting their efforts back into your community – there can be positives for everyone.” Together they have been working directly with financial service providers across South America – the data that they have collected reveals the challenges facing migrants and, also the market opportunities that open, if forcibly displaced people are better served. Get ready to hear very practical ways for banks and other financial service providers to better support migrants, refugees and asylum seekers, while maximizing the gains and benefits for the financial sectors in their host countries. From designing and implementing tailored and people-centered value propositions, to sensitization and breaking paradigms, to recruitment opportunities and service delivery. Listen in to hear more.

What does it take to rebuild from failure? Social Impact Pioneer, Daniel Mangena shares his journey &#8211; boom to bust and boom again. Today Daniel is a global soul, five-time author, and entrepreneurial coach. Despite hitting rock bottom after losing everything, Daniel rebuilt his life in a unique way, offering valuable insights into recharging oneself, finding purpose, and achieving success through adversity. Daniel&#8217;s story is one of resilience and transformation. He candidly reveals that he once contemplated suicide, feeling that his life had lost all meaning. A late diagnosis of Asperger&#8217;s syndrome, coupled with amassing and subsequently losing a great deal of wealth, took its toll. However, he managed to turn his life around and is now dedicated to empowering others to do the same. As an entrepreneurial advisor, Daniel firmly believes that success is within reach for everyone, regardless of their starting point. He encourages individuals to identify their passions and determine which ones they are willing to endure numerous failures and setbacks for. When asked about his advice for entrepreneurs who lack formal backing, such as smallholder farmers in emerging markets, Daniel shares that hard situations can be an advantage. He emphasizes the resourcefulness and problem-solving skills developed through navigating challenging circumstances. Failure, according to Daniel is not an experience but a choice. Rather than accepting circumstances as the end of the story, he encourages individuals to view failure as a test or a bump in the road. Drawing on his own experiences and the stories of successful businesspeople, he highlights how failure often precedes great success. This podcast conversation offers a unique perspective on personal growth, success, and social impact. Daniel’s insights provide a roadmap for individuals seeking to rebuild from failure, find their purpose, and make a positive difference in the world. By embracing resilience, pursuing passions, and empowering communities, each person has the potential to create a life of meaning and contribute to a brighter future. As Daniel continues to inspire and empower others, his podcast episodes and books serve as valuable resources for those seeking personal and entrepreneurial growth. His message resonates with the human spirit, reminding us that success is possible for anyone, regardless of their past or present circumstances.

Navigating the tumultuous waters of non-governmental organisation funding, they&#8217;re pivoting towards innovation in order to achieve their ambitious missions. Paul Ronalds joins the conversation to share why Save the Children, went on a brave journey of transformation beginning by recognising the growing limitations of traditional philanthropy and grants. Paul shares how they embarked on a mission to explore new territories—impact investing, technology, and social enterprise and in the process set up Save the Children Global Ventures (SCGV). SCGV is the dedicated entity created to explore innovative finance funding mechanisms and take new technologies to scale.

Meet Isaac Nyangolo, social innovator, entrepreneur, CEO and Co-Founder of Zeraki. There have been great strides taken in getting children some education, but more than half all 10-year-olds from poor and middle income countries are unable to read and understand a short age-appropriate text. With the predictions of climate related disasters and migration becoming a reality, the access to quality education may well slip further.

In the bustling world of sustainable development, the term &#8220;just transition&#8221; has become a buzzword. But what does it truly mean, and why should businesses care? The recent podcast episode featuring Savanna and Joachim from the World Benchmarking Alliance (WBA) sheds light on this intricate concept and provides practical support for business practitioners navigating the challenges of delivering their organisations through a just transition. If we take no action to address climate change &#8211; estimates suggest that it will cost the world’s economy US$178 trillion by 2070. And yet if do manage to move our energy mix to renewables, for us to use electric vehicles and increase the energy efficiency in existing and future buildings – the ILO estimate that over 18 million new jobs could be created. This podcast examines the question &#8211; how can businesses ensure that these 18 million new jobs are open and available to everyone who wants one. And ensure whole communities aren’t disadvantaged by the move to a greener economy? Savanna, part of the research team, highlights the methodology, co-developed with the International Labour Organization (ILO) and other experts, focuses on ensuring a just transition as companies move towards a more sustainable future. The methodology is extensive, touching on stakeholder engagement, planning, job creation, upskilling, social protection, and policy advocacy. Joachim, the climate policy lead, delves deeper into the practicalities. He emphasizes the importance of companies not only creating green jobs but ensuring these jobs are decent and contribute to the net-zero economy transition. But why the emphasis on just transition? As Savanna explains, the goal is to ensure that as we transition to a net-zero economy, those affected are not left behind. It&#8217;s about a human-centered approach, ensuring that all stakeholders are part of the conversation and that the transition is equitable. This podcast episode, brimming with insights and expertise, is a must-listen for anyone keen to grasp the intricacies of this vital concept.

In a world teetering on the brink of 1.5-degree climate change, the need for innovative, forward-thinking solutions has never been more urgent. Big questions often require big answers that are often so lofty they are impossible to deliver in reality – especially when it comes to business transformation. Meet Social Impact Pioneers, Ariel Muller, Director of Futures and Strategic Initiatives and LiLin Loh, Senior Sustainability Strategist, both from Forum for the Future, both based in Singapore. Forum for the Future is a leading international sustainability non-profit running out of offices in the UK, US, India and Singapore. Since Forum was founded in 1996, it has been working in partnership with business, governments and civil society to accelerate the shift towards a just and regenerative future in which both people and the planet thrive. Listen in to this podcast conversation to hear Ariel and LiLin reach from future system level sustainable thinking to practical business orientated solutions. Join these experts in the realm of futures thinking and sustainability. This is a masterclass in how to anticipate, imagine, and make decisions today for a better tomorrow. Futures thinking, as Ariel Muller, Director of Futures and Strategic Initiatives at Forum for the Future explains, is a practice of imagination and anticipation. It&#8217;s about observing current trends and signals, then using that data to envision possible futures. This isn&#8217;t crystal ball gazing; it&#8217;s a rigorous, collaborative process that can help businesses, governments, and individuals prepare for what&#8217;s coming. Ariel, with a background in creative and values-driven work, emphasizes the importance of combining futures thinking with systems thinking. This dual approach not only helps us understand what might happen in the future but also delves into the power dynamics and structural aspects that shape those outcomes. But how does this all tie into sustainability? LiLin Loh is a Senior Sustainability Strategist also with Forum for the Future, based in Southeast Asia. She brings the conversation down to earth by discussing the practical challenges businesses face in their value chains, particularly in responsible recruitment. LiLin highlights the culture of fear that often prevents companies from addressing deep-rooted issues, opting instead for surface-level compliance. LiLin’s experience working directly with businesses has shown her the need to go beyond mere compliance and engage in multi-solving—addressing both immediate and long-term risks. So, if you&#8217;re intrigued by the idea of futures thinking, keen to tackle sustainability challenges, or simply want to understand how to navigate the complex landscape of modern business, this is the podcast for you.

People have been working to create gender equity but the results aren’t making enough of a difference. Is one solution – including men in gender empowerment? The International Center for Research on Women (ICRW), Hand in Hand and Cartier Philanthropy have teamed up to better understand what it would take to help men, help women. In some parts of the world, a conflux of challenges face people – women’s role is perceived as predominantly in the home, visiting friends, or making money is at her husband’s discretion. In these same places few people are employed in the formal economy and living on less than $2.15 a day – and micro-entrepreneurship is the only route out of poverty. It is these places that Hand in Hand have focused their work. This podcast peels back the data to reveal the impacts of men and women’s engagement to create gender equity. Three years ago, Hand in Hand started an ambitious new project to shift the norms and attitudes that hold women entrepreneurs back in rural Arusha, Tanzania – working with ICRW and Cartier Philanthropy. Today we hear from Social Impact Pioneers Dorothea Arndt, and Ravi Verma as they share the learning from this work. Dorothea is the CEO of Hand in Hand International.

Poverty and climate change exacerbate gender-based violence (GBV). In regions affected by climate crises, such as extreme heat or natural disasters exacerbate poverty especially for women and girls. Poverty-stricken areas see higher instances of GBV, partly due to heightened tensions and stressors, including resource scarcity and economic struggles. How can business address gender based violence and gender inequality? To address gender-based violence and inequality, businesses can integrate climate resilience with gender mainstreaming and transformative change. Businesses should consider violence against women a grave human rights violation; participate in campaigns against gender-based violence; and challenge harmful social norms. Recognising gender inequality as a driver of poverty, businesses can work to empower women and engage men in their programs, understanding that gender-based violence is not only a women&#8217;s issue. How do the experts in gender inclusion tackle gender based violence? Experts in gender inclusion tackle gender-based violence by addressing underlying gender inequalities and deeply understanding the impacts of wider social and environmental impacts – such as poverty and climate change. Experts recognise gender-based violence as a violation of human rights and a barrier to development. By integrating gender mainstreaming and striving for gender transformative change, they aim to empower women and involve men in challenging harmful norms. This approach includes economic empowerment programs and community involvement to reduce violence and promote equality.

421769,"Regenerative Enterprise: Pioneering a Sustainable Future, with Niels de Fraguier",https://businessfightspoverty.org/regenerative-enterprise-pioneering-a-sustainable-future-with-niels-de-fraguier,"Regenerative Enterprise: Pioneering a Sustainable Future Can regenerative enterprise create the sustainable business model needed to address climate change, end poverty, and help everyone be included in a better future? In the world of activism and scepticism, there are calls for radical divergence from capitalist, consumerism. Social Impact Pioneer Niels de Fraguier is championing another path &#8211; regenerative enterprise. A term that encapsulates the idea of not just sustaining but actively replenishing and restoring through business. On the eve of COP28 – as the world sharpens its focus on the global challenge of climate change – listen in to this podcast for refreshing insight into how business can be a part of the solution. Niels is a seasoned activist who started his career working with refugees and vulnerable groups. This work involved policymaking and collaboration with organisations like the UN, European Commission, and the Council of Europe, before he turned his attention to business. Exploring the question – how can the energy and efforts of business be harnessed to ensure the sustainable future we need? Listen in to Niels as he thoughtfully unpicks how businesses can pivot to support more people…this is a conversation of practical steps and key questions that could enable business decision makers to pivot their work – resulting in better run businesses fit for the future and, hopefully, regenerating social and environmental outcomes. As Niels explains ‘doing no harm is not good enough – businesses must contribute positively and regeneratively.’ Questions this podcast explores: How do we make sure business is fit for the future? To make businesses fit for the future, it&#8217;s crucial to embrace regenerative practices, going beyond sustainability to replenish and repair the world. This involves redefining success to prioritise social and environmental goals alongside profit, ensuring business activities contribute positively to society and the environment. Key strategies include adopting a circular economy model, respecting local communities and ecosystems, fostering diversity and equity in the workplace, and innovating for positive impact. Businesses should strive to be a force for good, transforming their operations to create a more equitable, sustainable, and thriving future for all. Can business continue as before for a sustainable future? Businesses must evolve beyond traditional sustainability for a sustainable future. Regenerative enterprise focuses on replenishing ecosystems and empowering human potential, not just minimizing harm. This approach involves embedding evolutionary purpose, respecting interconnections and locality, and fostering well-being, participation, and resilience. It&#8217;s about creating value in multiple forms, not just financial gain. Companies should challenge the status quo, promoting systemic change towards a more equitable, thriving world. This transformation requires collaboration, innovative thinking, and a commitment to long-term, positive impact on people and the planet. How should business tackle climate change? Businesses can address climate change by adopting a regenerative approach, focusing on restoring and replenishing ecosystems and communities. They need to shift from exploitation and resource extraction to sustainable practices that consider human potential and intergenerational equity. Collaboration, embracing diversity, and innovating for systemic change are key. This holistic approach ensures businesses contribute positively to the planet and people.

421976,Exploring the Role of Carbon Markets in Climate Change Solutions: Insights from COP28 with Sheri Hickok,https://businessfightspoverty.org/carbon-markets-solutions-insights-from-cop-28-with-sheri-hickok,"In this episode, we dive deep into the role of carbon markets in addressing the global challenge of climate change. Recorded at COP28, from Dubai, Social Impact Pioneer Sheri Hickok provides a 101 on the function of carbon markets and their evolution through carbon offsetting hiccups; whilst giving us a glimpse behind the curtain of the globe’s climate conference. Sheri is the CEO of Climate Impact Partners. With over 25 years of experience in the renewable energy and now the carbon markets – she explains how companies utilise these markets to achieve their sustainability goals. The conversation demystifies the concept of carbon markets, moving beyond the simple notion of tree planting to explore comprehensive strategies like agroforestry projects in Indonesia, community engagement and additive contributions. Together we talk creating jobs, enhancing community livelihoods, improving local biodiversity, and the regulation that is being developed to ensure carbon markets don’t fall into green washing. Sheri talks about the African Carbon Markets Initiative (ACMI) – where African nations countries can transfer carbon credits earned from the reduction of their greenhouse gas emissions to other countries in order to meet their climate targets. By 2030 the ACMI aims to: Produce 300 million carbon credits annually; Unlock $6bn in revenue; Create 30mn jobs. Listeners are encouraged to join the conversation and contribute their perspectives. This episode is not just an informative session; it’s a call to action for collective efforts in combating climate change through innovative solutions like carbon markets. As the climate crisis looms larger, this podcast episode offers valuable insights and inspires hope by showcasing effective strategies and real-world examples of progress in the fight against global warming. Questions this podcast explores: What are the voluntary carbon markets? Voluntary carbon markets allow corporates, private investors, and governments to fund projects like planting trees, building nurseries, and creating jobs in areas most impacted by climate change. The goal is to drive real change by avoiding new emissions or removing existing ones. These markets are also about ensuring projects are designed with a solid baseline to measure emissions reduction, considering additional funding needs, and maintaining long-term sustainability. The podcast conversation highlights the importance of transparency, community engagement, and addressing potential downsides like offsetting criticisms. Overall, climate markets represent a collaborative effort to finance impactful environmental projects, aligning with global efforts towards achieving net zero emissions. How can carbon markets avoid green washing? To effectively avoid greenwashing in carbon markets, it’s crucial to prioritize genuine climate solutions over mere appearance. This involves ensuring that carbon market investments drive real change by funnelling funds into impactful projects, particularly in developing countries most affected by climate change. Transparency and accountability are key, with robust project baselining to measure true emission reductions. Investments should be additional, meaning they finance projects that wouldn’t occur without this support. It’s also vital to ensure that these projects, like the agroforestry initiative in Indonesia, provide long-term, sustainable benefits to local communities, including job creation and enhanced livelihoods. This approach not only tackles emissions but also addresses social and economic challenges, making the carbon markets a tool for holistic climate action. What are the latest developments in voluntary carbon markets? The latest developments in voluntary carbon markets are quite inspiring and exciting, focusing on solving climate change challenges. Climate Impact Partners is actively participating, seeking collaboration with corporates, private investors, and governments. They aim to invest in ground projects in developing countries, the most impacted yet least responsible for climate issues. These markets, expanding rapidly, are expected to grow three to seven times by the end of the decade. The focus is on creating projects like agroforestry in Indonesia, which not only plant trees but also build nurseries, create jobs, and improve community livelihoods. Initiatives like the Voluntary Carbon Markets Initiative and the Integrity Council for the Voluntary Carbon Markets are enhancing transparency and trust. Furthermore, developing countries, especially in Africa, are advocating for their needs, like clean cooking solutions, showing the markets’ potential to drive significant positive impacts globally.

Azfar, a Senior Economist at the Anker Research Institute, brings a wealth of experience from his over two decades at the International Labour Organization (ILO). His roles have included Head of Research for Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, Deputy Director of the Socio-Economic Security Programme, and Migration Policy Specialist. With a PhD in Development Studies and Economics, Azfar has also taught at the Institute of Social Studies in The Hague, Netherlands, and served as the Director of the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)’s Global Programme of Training in Population and Development. Based in Geneva and Beirut, Azfar&#8217;s work has focused on social protection, employment, poverty, labour migration, and the interplay of demographic and economic issues. Today, we&#8217;re zeroing in on his insights into living wages – a topic that&#8217;s more relevant than ever in our world of growing inequality and relative poverty.

Whether that’s cleaning, caring or generally working within the home or directly for one person or family, you will have been engaged in domestic work or know someone who is. The ILO estimates that 75.6 million people are engaged in domestic work around the world, and for women especially it can be an important source of income.

Social Impact Pioneer, Clare Fitton of Sedex joins us to talk gender data, ethical supply chain management and how it can enhance business performance whilst improving lives. Global value chains depend on hundreds of millions of workers to produce the goods we use every day – from our food, to our clothes, to our personal care products and cars. Women represent a significant proportion of workers. And yet in many countries, the rights, roles and support for women are different to men. From land rights, to financial access, to education. The UK’s Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office (FCDO)’s Work and Opportunities for Women (WOW) programme set a challenge in 2018 – to improve women&#8217;s economic opportunities through business interventions in supply chains. One of the first things they did was focus on improving the collection of data about women workers, working closely with partners Sedex, ETI and BSR. Because what gets measured, gets managed. Clare Fitton trained in Human Rights Law, specialising in Business and Human Rights and Gender Equality. She has over 15 years’ experience working with companies, trade unions, NGOs, investors and government bodies on the practical implementation and effectiveness of human rights due diligence practices. Clare is now the Sedex Members Ethical Trade Audit (SMETA) Evolution and Impact Lead within Sedex. Clare has a particular focus on social impact measurement and improving women workers’ access to their rights. Sedex has 80,000 members all of whom are now potentially benefitting from gender disaggregated data. Together we explore the strides being made in ethical auditing, data-driven improvements and emerging gender disaggregating audit methodology. We talk about how gender indicators such as higher numbers of women in supervisory roles correlates with a reduction in the likelihood of other risks. We discuss the broader implications of new due diligence and value chain regulations and how companies can navigate these changes through more effective use of data.

The UN estimated in early 2023 that six out of seven people worldwide are plagued by feelings of insecurity.

428356,Women Entrepreneurs and Digital Inclusion with Elizabeth Wells,https://businessfightspoverty.org/women-entrepreneurs-and-digital-inclusion-with-elizabeth-wells,"Social Impact Pioneer Elizabeth Wells talks about women entrepreneurs and digital inclusion. Elizabeth is currently the Head of Entrepreneurship at the Cherie Blair Foundation for Women. The Foundation is on a mission to eliminate barriers to entrepreneurship for women, helping to enable global economic gender justice. Elizabeth’s work within the organisation is focused on unlocking the power of digital for women’s entrepreneurship. With 10 years of experience working on women’s economic empowerment, economic development, and governance programmes, Elizabeth shares why digital exclusion is particularly pronounced for women – from access to mobile handsets, digital connectivity, low digital literacy and the high associated costs. Elizabeth reveals the potential of integrating digital tools in business operations for women. Whether it’s mobile money and online transaction systems, that helps to provide financial autonomy; through to book-keeping and client management that enhances business efficiency. Elizabeth is passionate about working in partnership with private and public sector organisations and has delivered this in some 12 different countries. Her experience includes working with partners like Qualcomm, DHL Express, FCDO and USAID. Together we talk about some of the partnering opportunities that can better serve female entrepreneurs. Elizabeth says – “There is a lot of excitement around AI. Digital inclusion is critical to business success and, if women are digitally excluded &#8211; whether it’s because of poor connectivity or infrastructure, high cost of data or lack of mobile phone ownership or access – women will never achieve their potential in business.” Please find here the links to the reports: GSMA Mobile Gender Gap Report 2023 Cherie Blair Foundation for Women Research Reports Bridging the Divide: Women, Tech and Business Success Cherie Blair Foundation website Cherie Blair Programmes Cherie Blair HerVenture Cherie Blair Mentoring",2024-07-11 12:59:10,Podcasts,Audio,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BRxOqLU-8XxEFWZ9HHFieEHeUsTrhaWE/view?usp=drive_link,✅,,,,,,,uploaded,uploaded,,,

Social Impact Pioneers Kalkidan (Kal) Lakew and Emily Janoch from the international NGO, CARE, explore how VSLAs facilitate financial inclusion, foster social empowerment and encourage community solidarity. Kal is the Program Coordinator for CARE&#8217;s Women (in VSLAs) Respond initiative. Whilst Emily Janoch is the Associate Vice President for Thought Leadership and Design at CARE. During this conversation, they not only deep dive into the benefits and outcomes of VSLAs but also look critically at the role of international development programme design, iterative improvements and the benefits of responsive community led feedback. Kal explains: “By listening and learning from women and girls in Village Savings and Loan Associations and understanding the impact of different crises and shocks – we can help to refine how the VSLAs work and determine what to prioritise.” Whilst Emily shares, “I am focused on finding ways to leverage evidence and learning to improve impact, build dignity, and eradicate poverty.” What are Village Savings and Loan Associations &#8211; VSLAs? VSLAs serve as a grassroots financial model where members—predominantly women—save together and access small loans. Originating in Niger in 1991, these associations have become a cornerstone of development programs, addressing food security, nutrition, and education. They are crucial in regions where access to formal financial services is scarce, enabling members to manage their funds and make collective decisions. Kal and Emily are finding that VSLAs go beyond mere financial transactions. They empower women by breaking social and economic barriers, enhance community negotiating power, and address critical social issues like education and early marriage. Through collective action, VSLAs enable women to increase their confidence and achieve remarkable community contributions, from starting businesses to advocating for educational facilities. How effective feedback improves outcomes Today’s discussion will also touch on the importance of adapting development initiatives to the specific contexts and needs of communities. Kal and Emily explore effective strategies for ensuring that development interventions are responsive, sustainable, and scalable. They share insights on engaging with communities as equal partners, emphasising the necessity of listening and learning from those we aim to support. Listen in to find out more.

433379,Measuring Impact and Impact Per Dollar with Gilad Tanay,https://businessfightspoverty.org/measuring-impact-and-impact-per-dollar-with-gilad-tanay,"How can we measure impact and outcomes from social programmes that work for business? Our Social Impact Pioneer today believes that ESG initiatives need a unified impact measurement scale – impact per dollar. Meet Gilad Tanay, Founder and Chairperson of the ERI Institute. “Impact per Dollar gives investors a tangible percentage figure or impact unit of a particular initiative, i.e. how many people lifted from poverty per $10k invested.” Says Gilad. Gilad founded the ERI &#8211; which stands for the Effective Research for Impact – and that is what they do. ERI is a pioneering research organisation dedicated to identifying and maximising “Impact per Dollar” in philanthropy, ESG investing, with business and global development initiatives. With a background spanning academia and high-impact consulting, Gilad’s work has informed strategies for governments, major NGOs, and philanthropic funds worldwide. Before establishing ERI, Gilad co-founded and served as a director of Academics Stand Against Poverty (ASAP) and lectured on the Global Justice Programme at Yale University. Recognised for his insights on global inequality and poverty alleviation (including a TEDx talk at Yale – see below for links), Gilad left a traditional academic career to solve tangible, high-stakes problems. His approach centres on creating unified, evidence-based impact measurement frameworks—tools that empower investors, companies, and donors to truly understand the return on their social investments. In this conversation, we’ll unpack why the current ESG landscape often fails to deliver systemic change, and how “impact per dollar” can revolutionise social impact. Gilad discusses how unified metrics—similar to a financial ROI—let funders identify which initiatives genuinely lift communities out of poverty. He highlights the importance of direct cash transfers, skill-building programs, and fair labour practices to break the poverty trap, emphasising that businesses can become powerful agents of change when they address root causes rather than apply superficial fixes. Get ready for a thought-provoking dialogue on aligning profits with purpose, the urgent need for standardised impact metrics, and how the business sector can seize its unique position to tackle the world’s most devastating poverty-related diseases and inequalities. If you’ve ever wondered how to make social impact capital more transformative, this episode is your roadmap to higher-impact social investments.

433578,How Social Work Combats Poverty with Peter Buturo,https://businessfightspoverty.org/how-social-work-combats-poverty-with-peter-buturo,"Dive deep into the transformative world of social work, with Social Impact Pioneer, Peter Buturo. As Peter champions the vital force social work offers to strengthen communities, combat poverty, and champion justice. Peter is a seasoned social worker actively engaged in the field. During this conversation hear Peter’s inspiring journey into social work, sparked by personal tragedy and fuelled by a deep-seated desire to make a real difference in people’s lives. At the age of 16, Peter suffered the loss of his mother, uncle and grandparents. This devastation led him to reach crisis point as he battled with suicide. At the age of 17, Peter navigated life without parents in the UK. Fast forward to 2011 and Peter graduates from Birmingham City University as a qualified social worker. In our discussion, we address how and why social workers played such an important part in his own journey.

Peter emphasises the necessity of empathy and collaboration across societal sectors to foster real change. This episode not only sheds light on the day-to-day realities of social workers but also delves into broader societal issues like domestic violence and the systemic challenges that professionals face in safeguarding the welfare of children and families. Stay tuned as we uncover effective strategies for improving social systems and hear firsthand from someone who&#8217;s not only in the trenches but also looking ahead to the future of social care.

433859,"Microbusinesses and Digital Inclusion with Amalia, Payal &#038; Werner",https://businessfightspoverty.org/microbusinesses-systemic-change-digital-inclusion-with-amalia-payal-werner,"Social Impact Pioneers &#8211; Werner Wallner, Managing Director of the Hilti Foundation; Amalia Johnsson, CEO of Hand in Hand International; and Payal Dalal, Executive Vice President of Global Programmes at the Mastercard Center for Inclusive Growth join us to share their wisdom. With decades of experience in financial inclusion, entrepreneurship acceleration, and economic development, they bring invaluable insights into how small businesses can transform lives—and entire economies. Why Microbusinesses Matter Microbusinesses make up 90% of global enterprises and contribute to over 50% of global GDP. In Kenya alone, 50% of working-age adults are informal entrepreneurs living below the poverty line. Strategic investment in this sector could boost national GDP by as much as 60%. Hand in Hand’s acceleration programmes—which offer advanced business training, credit access, and robust market linkages—have already increased participant incomes by 140%, often placing them among the country’s top 15% of earners. But despite their enormous potential, micro-entrepreneurs remain the most underserved economic players, especially women. This episode delves into how we can change that. Delivering System-Level Change Transforming microenterprise growth isn’t about isolated interventions—it requires systemic change. Our guests discuss how governments, financial institutions, and NGOs must coordinate efforts to unlock the full potential of micro-entrepreneurs. From broadening financial access to redefining women’s role in entrepreneurship, this conversation underscores the urgency of moving beyond ‘entrepreneurs by necessity’ and recognising them as economic powerhouses. Werner shares how financial inclusion initiatives have enabled thousands of women to build credit histories, access financing, and achieve long-term business growth. Meanwhile, Amalia highlights how tailored sectoral support for rural entrepreneurs is proving just as effective as urban interventions. Emerging Trends: AI, Cybersecurity, and Digitalisation The future of small business success hinges on emerging technologies. Payal discusses the game-changing potential of Generative AI, which is already enhancing financial coaching and unlocking new digital financing opportunities for small businesses. However, the shift to digitalisation also brings new threats—cybersecurity risks are escalating, and over 50% of small businesses that suffer a cyberattack fail financially. Our guests stress the need for proactive measures to protect entrepreneurs in the digital economy while ensuring technology remains an enabler, not a barrier. Whether you&#8217;re a policymaker, an investor, an NGO leader, or simply passionate about economic empowerment, this episode is packed with actionable insights and bold strategies.

433930,"Scaling Support for Smallholder Farmers, with Christina Mawuse Gyisun",https://businessfightspoverty.org/scaling-support-for-smallholder-farmers-with-christina-mawuse-gyisun,"How do you scale support for smallholder farmers, in hard to reach locations, harvesting a slow maturing crop? Social Impact Pioneer Christina Mawuse Gyisun, Co-Founder of Sommalife, joins us to talk about the shea industry in West Africa and how she and her team are increasing market access, and securing the future of an industry, by better supporting female smallholder farmers. Though women shea nut farmers provide a crucial raw ingredient to the $430 billion beauty industry, many live in extreme poverty, struggle with limited access to markets, and face the devastating impacts of climate change. Sommalifeis changing the game with a bespoke tech platform that digitizes operations, connects farmers to buyers, and empowers them as environmental stewards. The Problem: Systemic Exclusion &amp; Environmental Threats In West Africa, 60 million women smallholder farmers depend on raw commodities like shea nuts for survival. Yet, these farmers are often left out of formal markets, limited to selling their crop for low prices. Meanwhile, the shea tree—a lifeline for many communities—is at risk due to deforestation and vulnerable to climate change. In Ghana alone, 90% of charcoal production comes from shea trees, threatening both economic livelihoods and biodiversity. The Solution: Technology, Traceability &amp; Market Access Sommalife has developed a bespoke digital platform to connect farmers directly to international buyers, ensuring fair prices and financial stability. Since 2020, the enterprise has: ✅ Digitised operations for 110,000 farmers ✅ Increased income by 23% for 40,000 women ✅ Protected 1,500+ acres of shea trees By leveraging AI and traceability technology, Sommalife enables ethical sourcing, ensuring that farmers benefit from global sustainability initiatives. This innovation aligns with the EU’s Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CS3D), which mandates supply chain transparency. Call to Action: Investing in Social Impact To scale this success, funding, collaboration, and corporate partnerships are crucial. Companies and investors looking to create real change can support ethical sourcing initiatives that protect the environment while improving livelihoods. As a Schwab Foundation Social Entrepreneur of 2025, Mawuse is proving that sustainable business can be profitable and impactful. Will your organisation be part of this movement?

434873,Mobile Technology and International Development with Max Cuvellier,https://businessfightspoverty.org/mobile-technology-and-international-development-with-max-cuvellier,"How can technology, in this case mobile technology help people in hard-to-reach places and can it ever make our world fairer? These are two questions our Social Impact Pioneer this week grapples with daily. In this episode of the Business Fights Poverty podcast series – Social Impact Pioneers, we sit down with Max Cuvellier Giacomelli, Head of Mobile for Development at the GSMA, the global industry body uniting over 750 mobile operators and 400 tech companies. Max leads one of the most impactful teams in the world—Mobile for Development (M4D)—which has reached over 220 million people in low- and middle-income countries through mobile innovation. Max shares how the GSMA’s initiatives drive digital inclusion, financial empowerment, climate resilience, and gender equality, particularly through its Connected Women campaign and mobile money ecosystems. He unpacks how mobile connectivity is closing the mobile gender gap, with targeted programs helping over 80 million women access mobile internet and financial services, and how GSMA-supported startups like Crop2Cash are using AI to empower African farmers. We also explore the usage gap—the 3.1 billion people who live within network coverage but remain offline—and what’s being done to tackle digital barriers. Max highlights the GSMA’s push for commercially sustainable innovation, its AI Innovation Fund, and why ‘dumb AI’ built for real-world conditions in Africa may hold the key to inclusive tech. Whether you&#8217;re passionate about tech for good, sustainable development, startup ecosystems, or bridging the digital divide, this conversation is packed with insights on how to scale impact through smart, inclusive partnerships between the private and public sectors. Tune in to hear how GSMA is helping build a more equitable digital future—and why the road to socio-economic transformation runs through mobile.

407229,"What is Climate Justice, with Tara, Chris and Javier",https://businessfightspoverty.org/what-is-climate-justice,"What is climate justice and why should business put people at the heart of their climate action? Tara Shine, Co-CEO at Change By Degrees, Chris Coulter, CEO at GlobeScan, and Javier Aliaga, the Director of Fairtrade’s Center of Excellence in Climate and Environment joined together live during COP27 on Twitter Space and this is what they shared. If you want to know simply what Climate Justice is and why your business should start caring and promoting climate action, you’ve come to the right place. But don’t miss a moment, cause the #ClockisTicking. Tara, Chris, and Javier are leading experts in climate justice and business action across three continents. Together they share practical insights, articulate the business case for climate justice and tell first-hand stories of the impacts of climate action by business. Tara: “If you look at developing states, or the least developed countries in the world, the amount of carbon pollution they produce is still to this day miniscule. So it&#8217;s not their fault, this problem. And so that&#8217;s the great unfairness that lies the injustice that lies in climate change. And that&#8217;s why we have to find a just and fair solution.” Who needs to step up? Chris says: “We did a study in July across 31 markets in the world, 30,000 interviews, trying to track the evolution and perceptions and responses to the two big massive challenges the climate change crisis and the inequality crisis.” What’s remarkable now, is that this is the highest level of concern people are registering around climate change in 20 years of tracking. And the growth of that concern has been consistent across all parts of the world and has grown steadily in the last 8 years through the pandemic, which would have traditionally been one of those things that knocked off the agenda, and now through the cost of living crisis and the war in Ukraine. So we’re breaking new ground on levels of engagement and concern around climate change worldwide and one of the reasons for that is the immediacy of impact. Almost 4 in 10 people across the world say that they have been greatly affected by climate change.” Shedding light on business engagement with climate justice, Javier says: “The first step is investing to protect the most vulnerable ones, and creating resilience. And next probably is creating capacities and skills, transferring knowledge to these vulnerable people. And maybe last but not least, to promote a clear and transparent accountability. I think this is the framework for great use to promote in order to move forward.” We thank Pearson for being our learning partner and helping us to bring this to you.

410937,What Does it Take to be a Female Entrepreneur? With Naom and Natasha,https://businessfightspoverty.org/what-does-it-take-to-be-a-female-entrepreneur-with-naom-and-natasha,"What does it take to be a female entrepreneur…to inspire, to lead and to make change? This conversation hears from Social Impact Pioneers Naom Monari and Natasha Kwakwa, as they discuss getting started, how to build a business and why getting your first endorsement from another organisation can be a catalyst for growth. Expect to hear practical advice on succeeding as an entrepreneur and important tips on how to get the help you need to make a difference. Naom Monari founded Bena Care whilst she was still studying to be a nurse in Kenya. Naom is determined to narrow the gap between the harsh realities of chronic illnesses, expensive healthcare and the impoverishing economic and emotional effects this had on patients and their families. In just five years since Noam set Bena Care she has assembled a network of more than 9,800 healthcare workers to provide affordable, preventive, therapeutic and rehabilitative care to over 4,000 people with life-limiting illnesses at the comfort of their own homes in Kenya. Alongside the healthcare workers, Bena Care provide training for family carers and access to lower costing homecare medical equipment. Whilst Natasha Kwakwa is the Global Head of Impact at Standard Chartered. Natasha leads Standard Chartered’s approach to positive community impact. This includes the Group’s contribution to the UN Sustainable Development Goals and Futuremakers by Standard Chartered, their global initiative to tackle inequality. Natasha joined the Bank in August 2015. Prior to joining the Bank, Natasha designed and led multi-party education and social development programmes in the not-for-profit and public sectors in the UK, Angola, West Africa and Brazil. Futuremakers by Standard Chartered were one of the first, if not the first to recognise Naom and Bena Care’s potential. As Naom says: “My advice to any woman out there would like to bring change to their community through the solutions that they&#8217;re having to their problems is get started.” Links: Benecare Futuremakers by Standard Chartered If you enjoyed this conversation, take a listen to: Joyce Mbaya-Ikiao, Founder and CEO of Zydii and Futuremakers Alumni.",2023-03-09 11:06:20,Podcasts,Audio,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OHVkUBHUYZeTHAhmuLsKUXFxq9CKC_09/view?usp=drive_link,✅,,,,,,,uploaded,uploaded,,,
19095,Teyei Pam,https://businessfightspoverty.org/teyei-pam-director-tent3sixty,"BFP: What do you do? TP: I am a Director at Tent3sixty, I am a social entrepreneur, I work in business and at the same time in youth and community development, in particular business start up’s and enterprise development. Tent3sixty is a non – profit, NGO geared towards empowering youth with the right information and tools that will propel them into being transformational change agents in their communities and the world at large. Tent3sixty uses MDG 8 (Global Partnership for Development) as an important guideline in its work, and so advocates Global Partnerships for Sustainability. We have worked in partnerships on projects that are geared towards youth and community development, on environmental projects, such as tree planting campaigns and also on women’s empowerment projects, BFP: What is the best part about your job? TP: I love it when lives and communities are transformed and perspectives or world views are changed and improved. BFP: What have been your greatest challenges? TP: The need for people to have a paradigm shift and begin to move towards change and believe that we can actually be free from the slavery of poverty. Unfavourable government policies for youth SME development, especially in Africa, is also a huge challenge. BFP: How have you overcome these challenges? / What advice, would you give to others? / What is the secret of your success? TP: Passion, Patience and Persistence have been very important for me in overcoming these challenges. These 3Ps are my advice to others. Our passion must be compelling and contagious, we must be patient enough to stay on the mission regardless of slow progress and be persistent to keep the pressure on. The secret of my success is the fact that I believe in whatever I do or I’m doing. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do, where should they start? TP: I think they should start by identifying needs and doing their very best to address or meet these needs. I make emphasis on starting small. BFP: Finally; what do you hope to get out of being part of the BFP community? TP: I am already getting so much especially networking with other passionate individuals from different parts of the world for shared experience and expertise.

19098,Salif Romano Niang,https://businessfightspoverty.org/salif-romano-niang-co-founder-and-chief-impact-officer-malo,"BFP: What do you do? SRN: Malô is a Malian social enterprise committed to fighting farmer poverty and reducing vitamin and mineral deficiencies. We do this by 1) purchasing unprocessed rice from smallholder farmers at fair prices, 2) building modern processing facilities featuring technology that mills the rice efficiently and adds essential vitamins and minerals, and 3) selling high quality, branded fortified rice to consumers at affordable prices. BFP: What is the best part about your job? SRN: Although I am from Mali, I spent most of my life in Ethiopia and the United States so being back in my country of origin, as a social entrepreneur surrounded by family is wonderful. Travelling and meeting amazing folks across the world, and working on such a challenging but exciting venture makes if even better. BFP: What have been your greatest challenges? SRN: The biggest challenge to date was the politico-security crisis Mali went through since January 2012. The uncertainty and instability affected our ability to fundraise effectively, bring in equipment from abroad, and get the necessary government documents and permits to launch activities. BFP: How have you overcome these challenges? / What advice, would you give to others? SRN: On August 11, Mali elected a new president and marked an important step in the country’s recovery from the crisis so I am really looking forward to the rest of the year and 2014. While the crisis disrupted our initial model, plans and timeline, we remained optimistic but realistic. We adapted to the rapidly changing environment and kept moving forward. For example, we decided to put construction of our first facility on hold in 2012 but still managed to become the first organization in Africa to market locally grown, fortified rice by tweaking our model slightly. So my advice is to be keenly aware of the political and economic context and to think about and develop alternative plans and strategies in case something beyond your control disrupts Plan A. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do, where should they start? SRN: They can start by reaching out to me as well as others working on solutions. I am firm believer in building on the work of others and aligning interests. In the information era that we live in, it costs basically nothing to reach out to folks you want to learn from or to find the information necessary to build the knowledge base that is required to begin the process of starting a social enterprise such as Malô. BFP: Finally; what do you hope to get out of being part of the BFP community? SRN: I hope to make friends and learn about cool, provocative, ideas that effectively fight poverty.

19102,Raj Kumar Jani,https://businessfightspoverty.org/raj-kumar-jani,"BFP: What do you do? RKJ: I am a development professional (consultant) with over two decades of working experience with Micro-Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) who are mainly engaged in or working with rural farm and non-farm sector occupations in India and West Africa region. While working with poor producers and farmers, my focus lies on connecting them with Commodity Value Chains that they are working in i.e. with markets and mainstream institutions offering technology, design and financing options for instance. I also volunteer for social entrepreneurship networks like Changemakers, Ennovent and Rockefeller Foundation to help with outreach, entrepreneur support and review of entries towards various challenge contests. In my private venture which is a social enterprise, we are providing affordable healthcare &amp; wellness solutions to mankind especially poor and low income families by using nature’s vast resources and traditional knowledge systems based on herbs, crops and medicinal plants. Our motto is to integrate modern science with ancient knowledge and wisdom to create win-win both for producers and customers. BFP: What is the best part about your job? RKJ: What I like about my job is the amount of flexibility and adaptability provided by my nature of job because of which I can virtually engage with a vast number of producers and several other actors (stakeholders) in a given value chain at different levels where I find the gaps that exist. This becomes possible for me as being in development sector for long and connected to actors at all levels of micro, miso and macro, I can apply different lenses to analyse a value chain viz. pure developmental approach, business (private) point of view, regulatory/compliance needs and the perception of community/beneficiaries. Once I am able to find the right gap that exists in optimal functioning of a value chain, I am able to bridge it through my extensive knowledge about people and their socio-economic environments on one hand and on the other with information gathered about the market trends and demands, as I keep myself abreast with the latest happenings in business and society through my linked-in and many other valuable networks i.e. BFP. BFP: What have been your greatest challenges? RKJ: In business we often encounter challenges in terms of finding the right people and partners with similar aspirations and capabilities who can truly understand the needs of people whom we work with and also cater to, as suppliers and consumers; to empathise with them and to offer them products &amp; services, by assimilating vital information about the processes involved and the work systems under which the businesses operate. As against this, in development sector I often find challenges in working with those sets of people who don’t really value their own strengths; skills and assets for instance. As a result they constantly suffer at the hands of unscrupulous traders and marketers who don’t value these either. The more worrying factor here is the common perceptions of these sufferings as acts of God and destiny, because of which people at large continue to remain mired in their own cocoon and refuse to learn even for their own betterment. BFP: How have you overcome these challenges? / What advice, would you give to others? / What is the secret of your success? RKJ: I use ‘Information is power’ phrase to overcome challenges in both of these sectors i.e. business and development as it works in most of the situations! I have seen that people listen to you when you have something to offer them in terms of new knowledge about their work or their lives, while empathising with them in what they do. I believe, the challenges occur mainly on account of ignorance about our own immediate and external environment, which at large can be corrected by gathering information about what goes on in similar other situations/environments. I believe, we all have a natural tendency to follow best practices if we know about them. This is what I also preach as a trainer/motivator to my clients who are mainly young interns and volunteers, micro producers and other entrepreneurs; to gather as much information about one’s own environment as possible and watch for trends by using various media available to us, as the right information coupled with the right aptitude to work is the biggest key to success, in my opinion. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do, where should they start? What is the route you have taken? RJK: I believe, developing quest for knowledge should be the starting point. One should be open to learn from all available sources as one can, depending on what type of career one really wants to pursue. I always wanted to be a social entrepreneur, a businessman with a social conscience in other words. This is the reason I chose the not-for-profit sector after acquiring knowledge &amp; experience of international business management. Ever since then I have been busy acquiring the right aptitude to succeed in multi-cultural environment along with the key skills needed. I have adopted the ethical approach to sustain both my consulting and commodity business and trying to grow it internationally by expanding the product line and geographical territory. BFP: Finally; what do you hope to get out of being part of the BFP community? RJK: I sincerely believe and hope that business, if done in an ethical manner, can be the key to solve many of the current challenges that the world is facing- i.e. poverty &amp; hunger along with climate change as some of the burning issues staring us in the face. I truly appreciate the knowledge to do good being spread by Business for Poverty network and the quality of information provided by it. I believe the onus is on businesses to play a vital role to correct some of the ill practices of the world with the power of wealth and the resources that they possess i.e. technology and therefore I do hope to get associated with many other likeminded entrepreneurs and changemakers through your vast network to spread the good work happening in many parts of the disadvantaged world elsewhere. I believe that the best way to help the poor is to empower them with right skills and knowledge about their own work &amp; life environment while constantly trying and contributing to make businesses inclusive for the weaker actors in the value chains thereby allowing them to prosper together with the growth of the business.

19106,Katharine Bierce,https://businessfightspoverty.org/katharine-bierce-2,"BFP: What do you do? KB: At a high level, as a “connector,” my role is to see the big picture, scope a strategy and turn that into action. I identify challenges to be resolved, and what human, financial, and technical resources are needed to achieve the goal. In addition to gathering and organizing all elements of the big picture, I also help make sure the right people are working together effectively. More specifically, I currently work as an independent consultant to start-ups, nonprofits, and technology companies on a variety of things. I do everything except write software – I do business development, marketing/communications, recruiting, project management, event planning, fundraising and pitch decks/proposal writing. BFP: What is the best part about your job/ project? KB:The best part of being an independent consultant is having a variety of projects to work on, doing work that is interesting and meaningful. For example, one company I work with is the software and product development firm Cloud City Development. They are a team of people who want to make a difference with their work, not only to generate revenue and jobs, but also to make an impact in several sectors: health/wellness, education, environmental sustainability, and a few others. They sought my help because I have a lot of connections in the social impact space, where Cloud City Development wants to find new projects. Working with people who share common values is really rewarding. It’s inspiring to be around senior software developers who spend some of their free time mentoring junior developers from different backgrounds or contributing to open source projects to help the community. It’s also wonderful to get paid to do work that I enjoy – networking to connect people and writing blog pieces on the value of diversity in deal flow, for example. BFP: What have been your greatest challenges? KB: Patience. Developing strong relationships takes time. Sometimes people are like rubber bands – you have to let them stretch away from you before they come back. One of my biggest challenges is acknowledging and letting go of expectations where I want everything to happen faster than it does. As an independent consultant, you need to strike a balance between trying to be helpful to everyone you meet and doing some initial work for free – since you never know where your next contract might come from – and prioritizing work that pays. BFP: How have you overcome these challenges? / What advice would you give to others? KB: I think what makes a good “connector” is someone who cares about helping people get where they want to go. If you can understand and empathize with someone else’s problems, as this article notes, you won’t just be good at networking or sales – you’ll do better in business and in life. I think the secret to my success is having a strong sense of direction about what I want to do with my life, and being able to combine analytical and intuitive approaches to making decisions. If you can articulate your core values, understand your top 5 strengths and translate your values, strengths, and skills to the workplace, you’ll do well. The ReWork Career Blueprint course is a great place to start figuring out how to identify and then align your values, strengths, and skills in your career. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do, where should they start? KB: For being a “connector,” I recommend the book A Whole New Mind by psychologist Daniel Pink, and Seth Godin’s blog. Both Daniel Pink and Seth Godin write a lot about how to create lasting business results by holistic personal &amp; professional development, and seeing and acting on opportunities that others overlook. If you want to be a successful freelancer, you have to be really good at understanding your clients’ challenges and be an active listener. But you also have to be persistent and assertive enough to know when to listen, and when to pitch and follow up with a proposal. I’ve published 5 pages of my best networking advice here. It’s about how to network to find a job, but it’s also applicable to networking and doing better business in general. Being an independent consultant can be stressful because you don’t always know where your next rent check is coming from, so you need to know yourself really, really well. Learning to meditate is great for managing the inevitable stress and anxiety that freelancing will throw at you. Jon Kabat-Zinn has done a lot of scientific research on the health benefits of “mindfulness-based stress reduction.” I personally like the Shambhala Meditation Center programs, which range from a once a week discussion group to week-long or month-long retreats. BFP: Finally; what do you hope to get out of being part of the BFP community? KB: Meeting like-minded people who also want to make a difference in the world and have an impactful career.

19107,Steve Wright,https://businessfightspoverty.org/steve-wright,"BFP: What do you do? SW: I work with two teams within Grameen Foundation to develop and support two poverty alleviation tools. The first tool is the Progress out of Poverty Index which is used to measure household level poverty to ensure the poor are included and are being effectively served. The second is Taro Works. Which is mobile phone and Internet based technology for field force management, and data collection. Taro Works enables social enterprises to gain greater insight into their customers to build better products and services and run more effective businesses. The PPI is integrated into Taro Works. BFP: What is the best part about your job? SW: Working with brilliant and highly motivated people to build products and services that alleviate poverty. I have worked in three very different domains with 10 years as a high school teacher, 10 years in corporate philanthropy and 3 years and counting in international development. Each has been unique and rewarding. What I am finding at Grameen Foundation is an extraordinary community of brilliant and dedicated colleagues. All problems exist to be solved. My daily challenge is just to keep up! BFP: What have been your greatest challenges? SW: Poverty. My less cheeky response would be “finding alignment”. Poverty is not the fault of the poor. Poverty is manufactured. Our economic system makes poverty. The good news is that there is an increasing awareness that: 1) poverty is ‘bad’ for everyone, 2) poverty is a systemic problem that requires conscious multi-stakeholder solutions. Grameen Foundation is very good at developing the necessary products and services to increase the agency of the poor so that they can be fully participating members of the global economy. However, the complete solution requires the alignment of government players to ensure the regulatory environment facilitates development as well as the private players to build long term trade relationships with the poor as well as bring appropriate products and services to scale. BFP: How have you overcome these challenges? What is the secret of your success? SW: Hmmm, well, success will be, as Muhammad Yunus says, when poverty is in a museum. However, the incremental success that we have achieved has come when: 1) the alignment is clear and all of the stakeholders are actively engaged, 2) we are able to experiment and learn from failure without becoming discouraged or defeated, 3) we clearly define success and constantly measure our progress to understand if we are headed in the right direction, and 4) we benefit from luck and flashes of brilliance. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do, where should they start? SW: Well, internships are the best way to get your feet wet in this work. Our Bankers Without Borders program is a great place to go to find out more. I certainly didn’t set out specifically to do this work. My goals have always been to be a net positive &#8211; give at least as much as a get. I have worked reasonably hard and been very lucky to be given great opportunities to contribute to the greater good. BFP: Finally; what do you hope to get out of being part of the BFP community? SW: First, I would love to recruit more organizations and individuals to join efforts in this work of poverty alleviation. Secondly, there are so many ways to create value within the global community of changemakers, many of whom are represented in the BFP community. I am eager to learn what new and innovative tools and methodologies we can use together to make a more just and sustainable world.

19131,Alexa Roscoe,https://businessfightspoverty.org/alexa-roscoe,"BFP: What do you do? AR: The Private Sector Team at CARE International UK works to change business models so that they benefit more people, in particular women, living in poverty. To accomplish this we work with companies to help create products and services that help end poverty and empower women and with governments and a range of stakeholders to drive inclusive economic growth. As a Private Sector Advisor, I work with our global teams to design economic development programming and to advocate for pro-poor development. It’s pretty exciting stuff. BFP: What is the best part about your job? AR: The best part of my job is that it embraces complexity, acknowledges that inclusive growth will require some fairly radical changes from companies and governments alike, and tries to tackle the challenge from every possible angle. This week, for example, I am working to promote the empowerment of over 30,000 women workers in Wal-Mart’s Bangladesh supply chain, publishing a business case for empowering workers, and advocating for the strengthening of the UK’s National Action Plan on Business and Human Rights. Suffice to say that it’s never boring. BFP: What have been your greatest challenges? AR: The sheer scope of the undertaking- ending poverty- is a given, but another practical challenge that many of us face is one of communication. Before coming to CARE, I worked as an ethical sourcing consultant and completed a Masters and Human Rights at the London School of Economics. In all these roles, I had the same goals and even worked with a lot of the same companies as I do now. However, the vocabulary of sourcing, human rights and development tends to be very different, which is a shame because it often keeps specialists in each area from collaborating together effectively. BFP: How have you overcome these challenges? / What advice, would you give to others? AR: Ditch the jargon! Actually, I’d go further and say that a prerequisite for success in this field, both for individuals or for companies looking to advance good practice, is looking across traditional boundaries and looking for solutions to major challenges from unusual sources. Vocabulary is certainly an easy way to start. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do, where should they start? AR: This can be a complicated field to enter because it is constantly redefining itself. I always joke that I’ll know when inclusive business becomes mainstream if I don’t need to half an hour to explain to the uninitiated what it is exactly that I do. I recommend that thinking about three things: what theme (business and agriculture, business and finance, business and gender?) interests you; what type of institution you want to work for (company, NGO, development bank?); and what role you want to play (research, advocacy, design?). Once you have good sense of what your interests and talents lend themselves to, that should guide you. BFP: Finally; what do you hope to get out of being part of the BFP community? AR: Inspiration! Nothing sparks new thinking like being around people who are equally passionate and contribute to an open sharing of failures, successes, and, most importantly, ideas.

19164,Mavis Owusu-Gyamfi,https://businessfightspoverty.org/mavis-owusu-gyamfi,"BFP: What do you do? Mavis: I am the Save The Children U.K. Director for Programme Policy and Quality, and I am responsible for the department that houses our technical advisors in Save The Children U.K. My department provides technical advice for the design implementation and monitoring of all our programs to ensure that we undertake robust practical research and evidence generation in our programming, and we also inform the global research agenda on what our programming tells us works and doesn&#8217;t work from our impact data. We are also responsible for inputting into and supporting strategy and policy processes both in Save U.K. and Save The Children International, and making sure that we are working together to build technical capacity across the country membership of Save The Children. There are 30 members of the Save The Children network, and the U.K. is the second largest member. BFP: What is the best part about your job? Mavis: What I find amazing about my job is the range of stakeholders that I get to work with. On a day-to-day basis, I could be talking to an institutional donor, like DFID, around a programming opportunity, a multilateral agency like the World Bank on a development opportunity, a national government about a challenge in-country or a large corporate about how they could contribute to a global development outcome. So, it means that if we are strategic and we are very clear about the development challenges that we are trying to help the world address, then we are well positioned to bring these partners together around a common agenda. We can be a great facilitator and broker across a range of key partners that are critical to finding solutions to development challenges, and that&#8217;s what I find most exciting about my job. BFP: What has been your greatest challenge? Mavis: I think my greatest challenge has been learning about a new organization. I&#8217;ve been with Save The Children now for two years. I came in from DFID and so making the transition from being a donor to being an NGO has been a very interesting transition, and I think my biggest challenge was just suddenly realizing that I didn&#8217;t write the check and, in fact, had to make the case for the check. Having been on the donor side for 15 years, helped a lot because I had a sense of what institutional donors and bilateral donors are looking for, and having worked on private sector issues a very long time, I also knew what it would take to attract private sector interest in this space. So, it was a shock, but I came in with a slight advantage having been on the other side and having worked with a range of similar partners. BFP: How did you overcome this challenge? Mavis: I think I constantly put myself in the position of the person that I was asking for the check from, so I was constantly asking, &#8220;What would the multilateral donor, the bilateral donor, or the private sector donor be looking for?” It was a combination of trying to put myself in the shoes of the funder while simultaneously really drawing on the knowledge and experience of colleagues in the organization on what we could realistically deliver, and feeling confidently enough in the brand to say, &#8220;No, we couldn&#8217;t do this&#8221; when we were asked to deliver something that I felt we couldn&#8217;t deliver on and in the long-run would affect our reputation. BFP: What do you hope to get out of being part of the Business Fights Poverty community? Mavis: I joined Business Fights Poverty when I was the Head of Profession, Private Sector, at DFID, and my ambition there was to help the business community realize that DFID is open for business. My ambition hasn&#8217;t changed. I want business to know that Save The Children is open for business with business, and we&#8217;re open for a new type of partnership with business. CSR is interesting, but not sufficient for development outcomes. Core business, and how businesses operate in developing context for development outcomes is the partnership that we would like to talk about. Because we are a civil society organization doesn&#8217;t mean our relationship has to be purely civil and social corporate responsibility. We can do a lot more, and we would like the partnership to be a new one. So, that&#8217;s what I would like to get out of the community. For all business members of Business Fights Poverty, we&#8217;re open for new partnerships! Save the Children is currently recruiting for a Head of Business Partnerships (Programmes).

19217,Mohamed Ali,https://businessfightspoverty.org/mohamed-ali,"MA: I incubate and nurture youth entrepreneurs in post-conflict countries, starting with my country of birth Somalia, as a tool to accelerate peace and promote stability. I believe that entrepreneurship can change the world and use my organization, Iftiin Foundation, connect and foster an ecosystem of young entrepreneurs doing extraordinary in countries like Somalia. Iftiin means ‘light’ in Somali and the organization was established to inspire hope and lasting peace and prosperity in impoverished conflict-affected communities. The foundation seeks to foster economic growth by implementing positive youth development programs to assist local populations in emerging from poverty and preventing youth involvement in conflict, terrorism and piracy. I also engage Somali youth in leadership and training initiatives to effectively address the complex issues hindering the success of youth in a post-conflict environment. BFP: What is the best part about your job? MA: I recently held a youth leadership and entrepreneurship summit in Mogadishu. We brought together 80 youth leaders, activists and entrepreneurs to brainstorm entrepreneurial projects and enterprises to the address greatest challenges facing the city. Ideas ranged from creating a private ambulance service to fill the gap of emergency services to micro-enterprise programs addressing the needs of street children. I was inspired by their creativity and their commitment to making their city a better place to live. The best part of my job is interacting with this new generation of young innovators, leaders and social entrepreneurs living in Somalia and in other conflict affected regions. These are dynamic, innovative and courageous young people who are transforming their country and contributing to peace and development. BFP: What have been your greatest challenges? MA: Countries like Somalia for too long, have become synonymous with images of violence, anarchy and civil-strife. When I mention Somalia and entrepreneurship in the same sentence, the reactions vary from skepticism to surprise. This single narrative has been my biggest challenge in engaging impact investors in support entrepreneurs in the region. BFP: How have you overcome these challenges? / What is the secret of your success? MA: There are stories of hope, resilience, strength, courage, and persistence coming out of Somalia. It is telling these stories, and giving youth entrepreneurs a platform to broadcast their passion and ideas, that has been my greatest tool in addressing this challenge of shifting the narrative. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do, where should they start? MA: I began my journey in law, immigration and human rights law in fact. Entrepreneurship and youth social enterprise were not things that were in my vocabulary. During my work in human rights sector, I came to realize the important link between human rights and development and that economic and social development provides the basis for the general attainment of human rights. I began reading articles and blogs like Business Fights Poverty on the subject, connecting with online networks of social entrepreneurs and changemakers and attending seminars and workshops. BFP: Finally, what do you hope to get out of being part of the BFP community? MA: There are amazing entrepreneurs and changemakers who are fighting poverty and promoting development everyday in the BFP Community &#8211; I read their articles and blog posts and am inspired and excited by their work, ingenuity and passion. I hope to be continued to be inspired and use what I learn from them to support and promote the projects and ideas of the youth entrepreneurs I work with.

19240,Lina Maria Salazar Ortegon,https://businessfightspoverty.org/lina-maria-salazar-ortegon,"BFP: What do you do? LMSO: OMJ at the IDB was created in 2007 with the exclusive mandate of financing business models that serve the base of the pyramid in Latin America and the Caribbean. OMJ is the only operational unit at a multilateral development bank that supports market-based solutions to poverty. Since I started working at OMJ at the IDB I’ve been in charge of communications, outreach, technical cooperation or grants, and more recently I’ve become a part of the team that’s developing the knowledge production strategy. BFP: What is the best part about your job? LMSO: There are several things that I love about working at OMJ. OMJ is not only contributing to scale and expand business models that provide goods and services to underserved populations in Latin America and the Caribbean, but it’s also a pioneer in the field. It’s exciting to work at a place that has become a benchmark and a thought leader for others interested in low-income markets. Additionally, because we’re such a young crowd and we’re all close, working with colleagues at OMJ feels like working with friends. BFP: What have been your greatest challenges? LMSO: Among the challenges of working at the IDB is the process of understanding how a large institution like this works. It’s an ‘art’ to understand the Bank’s procedures, the hierarchies, the systems, the thousand acronyms, as well as—and probably most importantly—the internal social codes. Though challenging it’s definitely something that changes with time. BFP: How have you overcome these challenges? / What advice, would you give to others? LMSO: The only antidote to overcome this challenge is patience and good judgement. It’s very important to observe and learn. In general, I believe these two characteristics plus persistence are keys to success in this and any other field. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do, where should they start? LMSO: I studied political sciences and law. Then I did a Master of Public Administration. In one way or another I always liked and worked in public policy, communications, and outreach. I did a master to gain analytical skills and knowledge in economics. Even though I believe your academic background helps, there is not a unique recipe to build a career in development. I’ve seen a lot of successful people changing careers. The key is to network, network, and network. BFP: Finally; what do you hope to get out of being part of the BFP community? LMSO: I’ve already gotten out a lot of the BFP community. I’ve not only been able to promote OMJ’s content on the BFP website, but also I feel I belong to a global community that will help me stay connected to peers working in my field outside DC.

19306,Dr Ben Taylor,https://businessfightspoverty.org/dr-ben-taylor,"BFP: What do you do? BT: I develop ideas about how development could be done better, applying a more systemic approach to new fields and finding new ways of implementing development. I also provide technical assistance to development programmes on the implementation and evaluation of a more integrated approach to development problems, incorporating public, private and non-governmental sectors. I also teach on Springfield’s ‘Making Markets Work’ training courses aimed at donors, practitioners, and the private sector. BFP: What is the best part about your job? BT: Getting to really develop my thoughts and research at the cutting edge of effective development and then put these thoughts into practice. Bridging the academic/practitioner divide is a function that is largely absent from development and so I am glad to be able to play a role in addressing this. BFP: What have been your greatest challenges? BT: The greatest challenge is in trying to convince people to break with what they know and think differently about development. Many people talk about systemic change and sustainability without putting it at the heart of what they do. BFP: How have you overcome these challenges? / What advice, would you give to others? BT: Just like in systemic change programmes themselves, the key to changing behaviour is an integrated approach which requires different strategies in different circumstances. Publication of research, conducting training programmes and advising programmes directly all help the ultimate goal of more effective and sustainable development benefitting larger numbers of poor people. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do, where should they start? BT: Conducting research demonstrating the potential of a more systemic approach to development is something which can be embraced in any organisation with developmental objectives. Whatever your job, if you continue to ask why a problem exists you are more likely to get to the root of a problem. In attempting to do something about it, ask what will happen after I leave? Will the problem simply resurface? BFP: Finally; what do you hope to get out of being part of the BFP community? BT: From BFP I hope to both get and to give. I want to tell people about the work I’m doing so that they might adopt some of the ideas for their own work. I also hope to learn what other people are doing in pursuit of sustainable development to see if there are any ideas that I might adopt in my own work.

19324,Pauline Ngari,https://businessfightspoverty.org/pauline-ngari,"BFP: What do you do? PN: I set up Hand in Hand Eastern Africa in 2010. Our aim is to reduce poverty through sustainable job creation. Our first job and business creation program in Kenya was developed in partnership with Sida and FMO, who together invested a total $1.1m. Today we have generated over 30,000 small businesses and more than 40,000 jobs amongst some of the poorest in Kenyan society. BFP: What is the best part about your job? PN: Seeing how a job and an increased income can change lives from dependence to independence. What makes and keeps people poor is lack of an income. At Hand in Hand we give them the tools they need to start their own small business and generate their own income. Every day I see the benefits to families – more food on the table, children are sent to school not work and when needed, families have access to better healthcare and housing. The impact on Hand in Hand staff is also deeply rewarding, seeing them appreciate the role they play in changing people’s lives. BFP: What have been your greatest challenges? PN: Bringing about changes in attitude from ‘I can’t’ to ‘I can’ and ‘I will’ is definitely one of our biggest challenges. For example, saving is at the heart of our job creation model but, Kenya has a low “home saving culture”. So, we devised and launched the Home Saving Campaigns to help raise awareness of the importance of saving and enable people to realize that they can save, just a little, every week and this can be the first step out of poverty. BFP: How have you overcome these challenges? / What advice, would you give to others? / What is the secret of your success? PN: The key to overcoming any challenge is persistence and commitment. I always say to myself that if you start small and grow slowly you will be surprised at the big changes you can achieve. I would say to anyone just starting out ‘believe, begin, become’ and enjoy what you do. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do, where should they start? PN: I would say the most important first step is to get some experience in the field. Find out and understand the challenges that your clients face every day and that will make you their most effective voice. It might be a long journey and it might not come easily but be persistent and I am sure you will succeed. BFP: Finally; what do you hope to get out of being part of the BFP community? PN: I want to find out about and learn from other organisations and form new partnerships to further the cause of job creation. I also hope that others can learn from my experiences.

19352,Milan Samani,https://businessfightspoverty.org/milan-samani,"BFP: What do you do? MS: We run and manage high-performer leadership programmes for large companies. Recently we’ve been working in the ‘intrapreneurship’ space and were a lead partner on the Intrapreneur Lab at the Said Business School along with Accenture, Business Fights Poverty &amp; the Skoll Centre for Social Entrepreneurship. BFP: What is the best part about your job? MS: The work we’re doing now with intrapreneurs is exciting. Working alongside Accenture and Business Fights Poverty to help individuals from Barclays, GSK &amp; Novartis develop and implement ‘shared-value’ business projects requires us all to think and work very differently. And I’m a firm believer that leadership qualities are developed through facing and working through challenges just like this. BFP: What have been your greatest challenges? MS: I think our greatest challenges are yet to come but to date, the early days – when we were working to convince some of our largest clients and stakeholders that intrapreneurship was a huge opportunity for innovation and leadership – brought with them some uncertainty, which is always a little tough to handle. BFP: How have you overcome these challenges? What is the secret of your success? MS: More than self-belief was our belief in the idea – that supporting intrapreneurs within large companies could be a source of genuine shared-value creation and develop individual leadership potential. This was rock solid. I firmly believed (and continue to believe) that this is an idea whose time has come: and Leadership Laboratories was the right vehicle for it. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do, where should they start? MS: Give us a call – we’re growing! BFP: Finally; what do you hope to get out of being part of the BFP community? MS: For our first Intrapreneur Lab, we are working with a select group of individuals – many of whom are at VP or Associate Director level &#8211; from some the UK’s largest companies who are working on genuinely innovative shared-value projects. These companies told us that, through publicising this Lab, they saw that there are probably 100’s of such intrapreneurial projects hidden within their organisations. This indicates that within the FTSE 100 alone, there could be 10,000 intrapreneurs with ideas that could make a difference and make a profit. Today’s VP’s and Associate Directors will be tomorrow’s Managing and Executive Directors – and we’re excited to be working with BFP to build this community of future leaders who will be instrumental in shaping the corporate landscape over the next 5-10 years.

19403,Mary Mwanyika-Sando,https://businessfightspoverty.org/mary-mwanyika-sando,"BFP: What do you do? MMS: I work as a Maternal and Child Health Coordinator at Management and Development for Health (MDH). In my role I provide technical advice and facilitate the translation of new evidence based science on improving maternal and child health into implementable interventions that are applicable and sustainable in our settings. BFP: What is the best part about your job? MMS: As an expert in public health, I surely do not own the system, thus, I can say that the best part of my job is when I get to a point that I have managed to contribute towards the attainment of heath care standards that are in line with our policy and cut across the entire community. An example here is when my team and I were able to attain universal coverage of the prevention of mother to child transmission of HIV (PMTCT) from 52% to 95% in Dar es Salaam region within a span of just one year. BFP: What have been your greatest challenges? MMS: Knowing that there are many best practices and evidence based interventions that are important and could be implemented for scale up, but not being able to do that at the greatest length due to resource constrains. Thus, my greatest challenge has been on looking at and prioritizing the best approach/approaches to implement evidence based interventions to improve maternal and child heath outcomes to reach a wide community while using the same existing low resources and at the same time factoring in/ensuring that they interventions will be sustainable. BFP: How have you overcome these challenges? / What advice, would you give to others? MMS: The greatest tool for me has been working with the team, understanding what the priorities for each district and ensuring I align our workplan with theirs and our funder’s priorities. But most importantly for me its been getting my voice and ideas taken up and promoted by the stakeholders who own the health system as their own. In other words it’s working with the different partners in great collaboration and understanding their needs while helping them to create the demand from the system itself. For instance, we knew its was beneficial to integrate HIV care (providing ART in antenatal –PMTCT clinics) and thus by piloting the ART into PMTCT approach within the first few clinics, we were able to create the demand for scale up from the health managers for he same approach to be implemented in other clinics and the scale up of the interventions was lead by staff from the municipalities again ensuring ownership and sustainability of these programs. The advice I can give to fellow public health specialists, is to have in mind that no own the system and thus its important to factor in ownership and sustainability of programs hence its always great to do things knowing that when you are not there, the best practices will be continued by others. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do, where should they start? MMS: For physicians, I think its good to get some clinical one on one hands on exeprience with patient management. I learnt a lot while practicing as a clinician in an extremely busy HIV/AIDS clinic after completing my medical school training. It was there that I learnt the true challenges and hardships that thousands of people living with HIV and other vulnerable and poor communities face on a day to day. I heard a lot of testimonies from my clients who were mostly poor that even as we encouraged them take their HIV (ART) medication to enhance their clinical outcomes, it was hard to have 100% adherence having no food to eat or not knowing where their next meal would come from. This prior engagement with such a community opened my eyes to some of the real issues that one need to consider in planning for community development. This prior knowledge has added a lot to my transitioning from individual patient care to population health and development and thus knowing the real issues from the ground is an added advantage when one wishes to eventually focus on improving health of communities. Just to add, its important for one to keep updating themselves in knowledge pertaining to their respective field of interest and also be ready to learn through volunteerism, I for one have been a member of the Medical Women Association of Tanzania of which I also served as the Publicity Secretary for three years. We are all employed and thus have had to volunteer our time after work to work for our association which has achieved a lot in raising the awareness of female cancers in particular those leading in death in our country cervical and breast cancer. BFP: Finally; what do you hope to get out of being part of the BFP community? MMS: I believe by being a part of the BFP community, I will have a great opportunity to learn from many experts who have already done a lot towards development as well as fellow young colleagues who also have great ideas some of which are being implemented to help our communities thrive and improve in their quality of life. A lot has been done to promote development but I believe there is still a lot more to be done and we need to find local solutions to our local problems so as to maximize on outputs even in the extreme resource constrains that we are in.

19436,Tom Morton,https://businessfightspoverty.org/tom-morton,"BFP: What do you do? TM: I run the ClimateCare’s operations in Nairobi, Kenya. We finance and deliver projects that improve people’s lives and protect the environment. These two outcomes have been at the core of what we do since we started back in 1997. I also advise governments and international donors on matters relating to climate change and international development policy. BFP: What is the best part about your job? TM: Without a doubt it is when we bring people together to create larger outcomes than they could achieve alone. As an example, we have been working with a business in Ghana for the last 2 years, bringing in the investment needed to develop the market for improved charcoal stoves. We brought in capital funding from the BioCarbon Fund, then Registered the Program with the United Nations, so it is eligible for carbon credits. We have just agreed to sell the first four years’ emission reductions to the Swedish Energy Agency, who want to deliver tangible development benefits – alongside meeting their international obligations to offset carbon emissions. I often say that no two six months in my job have been the same and that is as true now as it was back in 2000, when I joined the company. It is the opportunity to think innovatively and see a measurable difference on the ground that keeps me interested. At the moment I am passionate about improving the way people cook and trying to reduce the demand for charcoal at the same time. This week, we have therefore been running tests on an efficient charcoal kiln next door to the office – turning all our hands black! BFP: What have been your greatest challenges? TM: The greatest challenge is finding really strong partners who share our desire to deliver measurable project outcomes on the ground and who we can trust to deliver, even in challenging times. The positive outcome is that by working so closely, we develop lasting relationships with many of our project partners! Another challenge I sometimes face is fear about our business approach to measuring development and environmental outcomes. This is a relatively new area and when you do innovative things, there is often an element of criticism, however it can be frustrating, particularly when you are all working towards the same long term goals. BFP: How have you overcome these challenges? What advice, would you give to others? TM: For me, it’s about focussing on outcomes, where it’s usually easier to find common ground, and then being open to new ways of delivering them. Everyone agrees we need to mobilise private and government finance to tackle sustainable development issues, and living in Kenya for the last seven years I have seen again and again what can be achieved when we get it right. This ‘results based thinking’ helps keep me focussed and motivated as we bring together a wide range of organisations and develop new ways to work together. BFP: Finally; what do you hope to get out of being part of the BFP community? TM: I know that delivering measurable outcomes through integrated Climate and Development projects works. It is already bringing government and business investment to sustainable development &#8211; through this approach we have already unlocked finance to improve the lives of more than 11 million people. I hope that being a part of the Business Fights Poverty network will allow me to meet new people from a broad range of organisations, with whom I can share this insight, scale up existing projects and forge new partnerships.

Right now, I’m helping to build a community for corporate change agents – or social intrapreneurs (The League of Intrapreneurs). My next project is focusing on empowering busy parents to embed sustainability into their daily lives. BFP: What is the best part about your work? MDP: The best part about my work is constantly stretching my brain to think of new possibilities and then collaborating with super smart, passionate human beings to make ideas a reality. BFP: What have been your greatest challenges? MDP: I feel like two challenges are constant for me. The first is &#8212; am I having enough impact? Is this lever big enough or even the right one? The second challenge is getting the balance right between spending time on work, on my family and on me. I am continuously re-calibrating to find a state of peace and centeredness. BFP: How have you overcome these challenges? / What advice, would you give to others? / What is the secret of your success? MDP: I certainly haven’t overcome them yet! My main success was to take control of my own destiny by working for myself. There are demands on my time for sure, but they are self-generated and at any point I can choose to slow down and take a breath. (Though I don’t do this as often as I should!) Also, having a community or support network – people I can reach out to during difficult times or who can stress test ideas – is incredibly important for me. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do, where should they start? MDP: 3 pieces of advice based on my own journey: + Build authentic networks. This is how you’ll get jobs, advice, support, etc. Networking isn’t about politics. It’s about connecting with others as human beings, discovering what makes other people tick and giving freely to others without expecting anything in return. + Follow your heart. You may not end up exactly where you plan, but if you listen to your heart and stay true to your values, you’ll end up in the right place. + Take risks. What’s the worst thing that can happen? The rewards of any risk taking far outweigh the perceived initial risk. Even if your first venture doesn’t succeed, the life lessons you will have learned dwarf anything you would have learned by staying put. BFP: Finally, what do you hope to get out of being part of the BFP community? MDP: Being part of the BFP community for me is about learning and making new connections. I’m looking forward to learning how others are making change in their work and addressing similar challenges that I face.

This includes managing the West Africa hub of the Africa Enterprise Challenge Fund (AECF) – a USD 200 million private sector facility backed by some of the biggest names in development finance. For the AECF, I currently oversee 20 projects spread across 8 countries in the sub-region (English and French speaking). Other aspects of my job include managing delivery of work, building/maintaining relationships with clients and other stakeholders and developing/maintaining global networks both within the larger KPMG and externally. BFP: What is the best part about your work? GM: Winning work and contributing to the growth of the firm. In addition, travelling to new places, interacting with people from various strands of society including the poor and successful entrepreneurs/business people alike, and learning. I have worked in over 50 countries in 4 continents, developed some life-long friendships and continue to learn a great deal from these exposures. BFP: What have been your greatest challenges? GM: Maintaining a healthy life-work balance, especially coping with the demands of parenting and a heavy travel schedule. Competing successfully in the development business can be quite tough, particularly when starting from scratch. BFP: How have you overcome these challenges? / What advice, would you give to others? / What is the secret of your success? GM: A passion for what one does, persistence and hard work are all essential. Be willing to associate with others who bring complementary strengths – two is better than one, and half a loaf is better than none. Make the most of every opportunity. I have a deep faith in God and owe every success to Him. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do, where should they start? GM: Start with what you have and do not despise the day of small beginnings. Education is great and helps open doors. A second or even third language is useful in development work. Overseas experience, even if in a volunteer capacity, is invaluable. BFP: Finally, what do you hope to get out of being part of the BFP community? GM: BFP is proving to be a wonderful forum for learning and keeping abreast of developments in the field. It is also great for networking. Additionally, it provides an opportunity to share and give back to the community.

19540,Tatiana Bessarabova,https://businessfightspoverty.org/tatiana-bessarabova,"BFP: What do you do? TB: I work at the UNDP-based Business Call to Action (BCtA) on strategic knowledge management with the main goals of raising awareness and building knowledge around the concept of inclusive business and around the BCtA members company initiatives. Our members are market leaders and innovators, committed to developing commercially viable business ventures that engage people living at the base of the pyramid as consumers, producers, suppliers, and distributors of goods and services. In close to 50 countries, over 80 member companies are spearheading efforts to provide the poor with the tools and resources they need to succeed by promoting economic opportunity. As a multistakeholder-supported initiative, BCtA provides a leadership platform for companies to demonstrate their commitment to development and to access global expertise on innovation at the BoP. You can learn more about BCtA, by visiting www.businesscalltoaction.org and by following us on Twitter at @BCtAInitiative. BFP: What is the best part about your job? TB: The best part of my job is witnessing the peer-to-peer learning exchange (reflected in public and private online discussions, case studies, reports, and events) between innovators, who challenge “business as usual,” but often grapple with barriers in achieving sustainability and scale in their inclusive business ventures. BFP: What have been your greatest challenges? TB: The greatest challenge about my job is achieving this peer-to-peer learning between companies. BFP: How have you overcome these challenges? TB: I believe that knowledge-based partnerships with leading organizations in the field, such as Business Fights Poverty, are essential to propelling the learning exchange. Joining forces, bringing experts to the table for facilitation and discussion, and giving companies the space in both open and closed-door environments help to foster the open dialogue and knowledge exchange around their business models. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do, where should they start? TB: There is a proliferation of organizations and companies, who fund, implement or advocate for inclusive business and where one can get a “foot in the door”. I do, however, believe that learning about inclusive business in action is best pursued by working directly for the companies that are championing inclusive business practices across their value chains. BFP: Finally, what do you hope to get out of being part of the BFP community? TB: Inclusive business will not scale without a solid understanding of what works and what doesn’t and understanding the barriers and solutions companies can use to tackle them requires effective knowledge exchange between practitioners. Joining forces with the BFP community helps to achieve this goal. Editor&#8217;s Note: Thank you to Tatiana Bessarabova for taking the time to do this interview.

19855,Ginnie Guillen,https://businessfightspoverty.org/georgina-guillen,"GG: I have two roles, I am a Project Manager at the Collaborating Center on Sustainable Consumption and Production (CSCP) and Vice President Sustainability Strategy at Concept Plan. At the CSCP I design and implement various programs for the enhancement of practices towards sustainable consumption and production. These programs are normally in cooperation with other organizations such as the BMZ or with private companies. In the last couple of years I’ve been developing multi-stakeholder gatherings with the purpose of developing action roadmaps through visioning and backcasting. My areas of work are mainly in the exploration of lifestyles (outside of Europe) and processes to make them more sustainable enhancing local and global opportunities. The other area I’m very linked to is organizational change mainly in the areas of capacity building within companies and supporting young entrepreneurs in the making of their business plans more sustainable. For ConceptPlant I am mainly an advisor evaluating the projects the organization proposes to different entities, mainly private clients. The idea is to identify the value in terms of impacts on sustainability that each phase of the projects convey. I also coordinate the team that checks compliance with local and international regulations. BFP: What is the best part about your job? GG: The diversity of people I have the opportunity to collaborate with and that every day it is possible to learn something new. BFP: What have been your greatest challenges? GG: The most difficult so far has been finding ways to collaborate with people whose way of acting is completely the opposite of mine. Designing and delivering workshops with these types can be exhausting and highly frustrating, so the challenge is to really try to reach your objectives without leaving your liver and peace of mind in the process. Also, a challenge is to present that working from the consumer perspective does not mean radical tree-hugging but more mindful consideration of natural resources. BFP: How have you overcome these challenges? / What advice, would you give to others? GG: There are various ways and most of them require patience and listening to the other party(ies); when misunderstandings happen because of ignorance or confusion of terms, a way to go through the bottleneck is to try to change the language we’re using for the communication, this does not mean switching from English into German but more rephrasing into concepts that mean the same to the other party and oneself. Also, a lesson I learned long, long time ago, is that we really need to start with a clean slate for every project, it does not mean developing something new every time, it means to first be very receptive to the local issues in order to develop or customize the tool/methodology that better fits the situation. What one considers may be the best for a person or a group from merely personal perceptions and experience (i.e. cement floors to the shacks of people in the mountains so they don’t need to sleep on mats on the soil) may not be what the other person or group really, really need (i.e. temperatures are very low in that mountain, concrete floors only make the rooms colder!) so the success factor is to ask the other party: what it is that YOU need? Language is such a key issue! If we keep using the same language that created the big social divide we have today, we’ll really get nowhere, rephrasing how we express ourselves about others, really supports this re-thinking process to change our consumption habits and push the supply as well. One of the beauties of working in teams is that they bring together all sorts of personalities and we find a common roof to work, so when dealing with particularly difficult organizations, there is always someone in the team that can support to “soften up” the discussions that clashing ways of work may arise. I am from the “Art of Hosting” facilitation school, this means, participants are free to work as they please and the facilitator is well, facilitating the session, replying questions and guiding the process. It has happened that the partner requested a facilitator per discussion table because for them it’s not possible to leave groups working alone. The solution? Ask them to be facilitators as well so they could do the moderation in the tables as they wished while I could deliver the session as planned. Each situation is very particular, and again, by listening what the other people have to say, is the way to really find a solution to the challenges. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do, where should they start? GG: From home actually, my parents brought me up being aware of what I needed things for and how to better use them and dispose of them. When at school, a good idea is to get involved with communities and learn to listen and to observe without judging. A key for developing a successful strategy is to recognize the factors that make each individual and community unique. Daring to ask questions and challenge assumptions is also a factor that helps a lot, I like “walking on the shoes” of other people and hearing their stories is a great way to do it. I wouldn’t say there’s a specific starting point other than start trying to really find the meaning of what you’re doing as consumer, as citizen, as member of your community… the rest just unfolds, seriously BFP: Finally, what do you hope to get out of being part of the BFP community? GG: More insights of how things are done in other places. What is driving social innovation, what individuals need and want, why… being in a network of innovators is always refreshing and eye-opening. And I would actually like to invite the participants to think on the impacts of their business initiatives in terms of the lifestyles they’re touching, shaping… and to share their experiences at the Global Network on Sustainable Lifestyles (www.vision2050.net) J Editor&#8217;s Note: Thank you to Georgina Guillen for taking the time to do this interview.

20220,Juergen Nagler,https://businessfightspoverty.org/juergen-nagler,"BFP: What do you do? JN: UNDP AFIM is advancing inclusive business and market development in Africa. We bridge partnerships between public and private sectors and develop capacity along target value chains contributing to sustainable development and inclusive growth, especially through job creation and income generation. For instance, we have undertaken regional Project Facilitation Platforms in East, West and Southern Africa advancing several key agri-food value chains such as sorghum, dairy, onion, mango, ground nuts and soy beans benefitting thousands of farmers and all value chain actors in each project. Personally I focus on partnership building, communication, innovation and project coordination. AFIM has released several knowledge products including the major report “Realizing Africa’s Wealth – Building Inclusive Businesses for Shared Prosperity”. BFP: What is the best part about your job? JN: I love working within the United Nations with people from all nations to advance universal goals. Considering myself a ‘bridge-builder’, it’s a privilege to connect different stakeholder groups, learn from them and facilitate knowledge exchange. This also allows me to be part of the paradigm shift in development approaches towards greater engagement of the private sector and enlightened business leaders to realize UN goals which links to my own work experiences from the business, NGO and UN worlds. As UNDP is consulting with people from all over the world about the post-2015 development agenda, I am also very grateful to broaden my own development knowledge and philosophy. For instance, the UN General Assembly clearly recognized the need to go beyond measuring GDP as an indicator for a country’s wealth and calling “happiness” a more holistic approach to development. BFP: What have been your greatest challenges? JN: Scope of demands and financial resource pressures have been the biggest challenges so far. As UNDP has a very broad global human development mandate it attracts very high expectations and demands from the widest set of stakeholders. Moreover, as some countries shifted focus on reviving their own economies UNDP has experienced challenging financial resource limitations. BFP: How have you overcome these challenges?/ What advice, would you give to others?/ What is the secret of your success? JN: A shared vision and positive attitude have helped me to overcome challenging times and to grow from self-employed entrepreneur to business manager and from UN intern to UNDP staff. My advice, even if it may sound philosophically, is to follow your heart and succeed in what one loves doing and is passionate about. Then one is able to work and lead not only hard but smart achieving transformative results. For instance, I honorary also co-facilitate the UN Transformation Network which is a close to 300 members strong group of like-minded UN innovators, change-makers and thought leaders that are interested in advancing collaboration, innovation and transformation within the UN system and its work, hopefully leading to a future-ready UN 2.0. Personally, I also see the importance of development happening “inside-out”, therefore inner work plays an important role in my life which includes personal development practices such as meditation. In many instances have I positively experienced that a shift in my inner attitude to a problem lead to an outer transformation &#8211; from a negative problem to a neutral challenge to a positive lesson learned. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do, where should they start? JN: There are many different ways to work at the cross-roads of business and advancing UN goals. For several years I have been sharing relevant stories and insights on my blog at www.business4good.org. Companies increasingly shift from philanthropy and CSR to the next level, may it be called inclusive business, creating shared value or whatever the name. Leading firms join the UN Global Compact or the Business Call to Action, so these are good sources of inspiration. NGOs also play an important role to bridge the ambitions of lead firms with realities on the ground, e.g. by mobilizing and building capacity of youth, women and farmers in rural areas which have been previously been out of reach for most companies. The UN is a highly competitive place to enter and there is no substitute to the right education and experience. Internships and consultancies provide ways to gain UN experiences and to expose oneself to the organization and its work. There are also national recruitment assessments for some countries and it is key to monitor for suitable positions to apply online, e.g. directly at the relevant UN agency websites or through specific search engines such as unjobslist.org. BFP: Finally: what do you hope to get out of being part of the BFP community? JN: I appreciate the platform for sharing knowledge and experiences, not only to fight poverty but to advance shared prosperity and sustainability. Therefore, it’s great to connect with like-minded people, share stories and together bridge the power of business for the greater good.

20325,Filippo Veglio,https://businessfightspoverty.org/filippo-veglio,"BFP: What do you do? FV: I work for the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD), a CEO-led organization headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland, bringing together some 200 of the world’s leading corporations spanning a wide range of sectors and geographies. The Council’s mission is to galvanize the global business community to create a sustainable future for business, society and the environment. Together with our members, we apply a mix of thought leadership and advocacy to generate constructive solutions and take shared action to tackle sustainability challenges. The WBCSD also benefits from a network of 60 national and regional business councils and partner organizations, a majority of which are based in developing countries. I am the Director of the WBCSD&#8217;s Social Capital Focus Area, which contributes business perspectives and solutions toward inclusive growth. Our work program embraces a wide range of issues: inclusive business at the base of the pyramid; access to energy; human rights; skills &amp; employment; rural livelihoods; and measurement &amp; valuation. BFP: What is the best part about your job? FV: I very much appreciate the strong professional and personal bonds that we have established across the years with those engaged in our work program. It’s definitely a privilege to be exposed, on a daily basis, to a great diversity of ideas, opinions and information (including through “on the ground” visits) emanating from a wide variety of sources – from senior representatives of our member companies to staff of business organizations, multilateral institutions, NGOs and academic entities. All of them come from different cultures, work-wise, but also in terms of geographies, which keeps things interesting. BFP: What have been your greatest challenges? FV: We are a small team tackling several topics, each one of which involves many interactions with our members and partners, so sometimes it’s not easy to “keep all balls in the air”. There is also risk of getting bogged down in process and discussions, losing sight at times of the bigger picture behind our daily efforts. Another challenge is that information &amp; knowledge does not circulate as quickly as one assumes, which requires perseverance and reinforcement (across years sometimes) for the results of our efforts to really kick in. Then again, these challenges apply to many jobs! BFP: How have you overcome these challenges? / What advice, would you give to others? FV: I have good language skills so this helps break down barriers, including by listening closely to what are people saying (and not saying!). Our team at the Council also always keeps in mind that it is essential for us to maintain the (big) business perspective in everything we do, as we are a business council, and not an aid organization. For instance, in the area of inclusive business, we did some pioneering work in Latin America in an alliance with our national partner organizations and SNV, through which we catalyzed investments and partnerships on the ground, in addition to conducting research and advocacy efforts. It was an exciting period, in which we had to reiterate time and again that our overall aim was to build sustainable business models, not handing out donations. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do, where should they start? FV: Tough question! I don’t have a clear answer to this, as my career path is not “traditional” – before my university studies I played professional tennis for 6 years, so I had an entirely different career up to my mid-twenties. I was always passionate about Development issues, though, and upon completing my Master’s degree in 2005 I joined the WBCSD, initially in the communications team (which was a great way to delve into the overall work program) and a bit more than a year after that I integrated the team focused on the role &amp; impacts of business in the developing world. Ever since joining, I have been lucky to have great managers who believed in me and pushed me, so 9 years later I am still here! Overall, I would say that passion, knowledge and hard work are essential – the rest will follow, including being lucky by being at the right time in the right spot. For instance, if you are passionate about your studies and/or your work you will more easily put in the hours, build relationships, seek out mentors, and generally be drawn to a community of like-minded people where you can further improve your knowledge &amp; skills, and strive toward achieving goals – including in terms of finding interesting employment opportunities. BFP: Finally; what do you hope to get out of being part of the BFP community? FV: I am a fan of BFP, and appreciate the dedication of the team running the show. It is an excellent platform to see “who is who” and “who is doing what” in our community, what the current trends are, keep track of recent events &amp; publications, etc. (though I am sometimes overwhelmed by the amount of information that is posted!). I also value BFP’s work in the social media domain, and refer as many people to the site as I can. While I contribute regularly through blog postings, I admit that I rarely use the site to connect with my peers.

20396,Heidi Kikoler,https://businessfightspoverty.org/heidi-kikoler,"BFP: What do you do? HK: I work on a 1-1 basis with people, either in person or over the phone, and we look at where they are today, where they want to be in the future, and we work together to create an actionable plan for getting them there. For example, in the course of a week, I may work with a stressed-out entrepreneur to identify what changes could be made in their work-life balance so that they feel more energised and become more effective in growing and running their business, I could also work with a corporate employee who wants to land a promotion and through identifying their limiting beliefs, they are able to dramatically improve their communication skills which then enables them to land the promotion, and I could also work with an intrapreneur who feels like they are at their wits end and are ready to quit and yet since that isn’t really what they want, we work on how they can build their resilience so that the next time the overwhelming desire to quit comes they know exactly what they need to do to sail straight through the experience. My specialty, based on my years of work experience prior to becoming a coach, is working with innovators – social intrapreneurs, entrepreneurs, social entrepreneurs, and sustainability professionals. I also keep busy by acting as an advisor to the League of Intrapreneurs, and speak about intrapreneurship and personal development at events like the Intrapreneurship Conference. Over the past 6 years, I’ve honed my niche skillset, and deepened my passion for personal development and corporate social innovation through working closely with many leading thinkers, brands, intrapreneurs and change agents, including: Virgin Unite, Sir Richard Branson, Virgin Atlantic, The League of Intrapreneurs, Shell, BP, Imaginals, and The International Exchange. I’ve earned a MSc from University of Oxford’s Environmental Change Institute, a BBA (distinction) from York University’s Schulich School of Business in Toronto, Canada, and a Certificate in Professional Coaching Skills from the highly regarded Coaching Development, in London, UK. I’m a member of the International Coach Federation. BFP: What is the best part about your job? HK: The best part is I’ve finally got a career, and not a job. What I do is incredibly matched to my talents, nature, passion, and the impact I’d like to have. It was only through receiving coaching myself that I was able to gain this clarity. I’ve been through a lot of exhausting and stressful career change – entrepreneur, advertising executive, 3 foundations, innovation consultancy… None of them ever felt truly right for me. I wasn’t doing what I felt I was meant to be doing. And now I do. It makes a world of difference to my everyday sense of fulfillment and happiness! Plus it is brilliant to witness real changes taking place in people that I know will lead them to the same sense of fulfillment and happiness! BFP: What have been your greatest challenges? HK: The biggest challenge is helping people understand the type of ‘coaching’ I practice. I provide zero advice to my clients. This often surprises people as there are so many different definitions of coaching floating about. I believe each of us receive enough advice from everyone else in our lives. To gain clarity we need to really start to listen to ourselves. That is the role that I play. I essentially mirror back to a person their best self as they’ve defined it. This enables them to think deeper, broader and different to usual. It allows them to understand themselves in new ways, which leads to a much clearer understanding of what they need to do in order to get what they want – be it a new job, better work-life balance, healthier and more productive relationships, enhanced leadership skills, etc. BFP: How have you overcome these challenges? / What advice would you give to others / What is the secret to your success? HK: I’ve had the privilege earlier this year of sharing my thoughts about this challenge with the Board of Directors of the International Coach Federation as this is a topic that should be addressed at their international level. In the meantime, I’ve learned to start with the other person. I understand that coaching is a hard to understand process until you’ve experienced it. I share the benefits the person can experience without mentioning ‘coaching’. I use storytelling as well. I only later mention how I do that I do, ie coaching. This allows a conversation to unfold rather than be stopped right at the start by having to clarify what I mean by ‘coaching’. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do, where should they start? HK: I started with Simon Sinek’s book Start with Why. Understanding ‘why’ you do what you do is a great place to start. You can fast track and watch his Ted Talk here. I test drove coaching by taking a short weekend course. This was incredibly useful to me. Another way is to hire a coach. Experiencing coaching from a trained professional allows you to really understand how it is different from mentoring, advising, consulting, counseling, and conversations with friends and family. You’ll be able to experience the value of coaching first-hand, and start to determine if the profession is a good match for you. BFP: What do you hope to get out of being part of the BFP community? HK: It is inspiring to see so many committed and talented individuals, from around the world, working in their own unique ways to make a real difference. This helps keep me motivated. I also really value the new relationships I’ve formed thanks to the network, the insights I’ve learned from the blogs I’ve read, and the opportunity to share my tips around resilience and intrapreneurship with a much wider group of people through the blog I write.

20520,Pauline Mujawamariya,https://businessfightspoverty.org/pauline-mujawamariya,"BFP: What do you do? PM: I am a Programme Director at the African Innovation Foundation. I lead the Innovation Prize for Africa (IPA). The IPA is one of the Foundation’s flagship projects, and it mobilizes African innovators and entrepreneurs by providing $150,000 to winners who deliver market-oriented solutions to the continent’s challenges and spearhead African-led development. I also oversee the foundation’s work on innovation and technology. My work involves building partnerships across the continent to strengthen an innovation ecosystem that will fuel African economic growth. BFP: What is the best part about your job? PM: Meeting innovators/entrepreneurs across Africa who are working on amazing projects and believe in their capabilities to shape the future of their countries and the continent! They take the initiative to use what they have at their disposal to create solutions to real challenges.… It is inspiring to watch and listen to many young innovators who see possibilities and options in everything. In addition, I love the fact that through IPA, the African Innovation Foundation is able to showcase African ingenuity and demonstrate how Africans are capable of innovating solutions to the continent’s challenges as well as the whole world! On a personal level, this reinforces my belief in the future of Africa, and the fact that, with Africans in the driver seat, we can get there, faster! BFP: What have been your greatest challenges? PM: Working towards bridging the language divide across Africa, whereby stakeholders from Anglophone, Francophone and Lusophone countries can collaborate in order to strengthen the African innovation ecosystem. While the realities on the ground might be different due to the cultural differences, there are so many exchanges that can happen to ensure that no one is re-inventing the wheel! It is starting to happen now, but not fast enough! BFP: How have you overcome these challenges? / What is the secret of your success? While I can’t say I have already overcome the aforementioned challenge, my approach has been to identify a few key stakeholders and individuals representing different languages and invite them to join us when we have an opportunity to bring people together, such as around our IPA Awards event and round table discussion. Having these stakeholders together in a room is the starting point, and the hope is that the discussion continues after the initial encounter. I guess the secret to my success, if any, is to follow my passion, believe in what I do and remember why I chose to do it. Remembering why I chose this area of work keeps me focused and allows me to deal with any challenges as I know they are distractions and smaller than the big picture I have drawn for myself! Also, it is important to focus on what can be done rather than paying too much attention to obstacles! My advice would be remain confident and accountable to yourself, believe in possibilities and link up with people who also believe that it can be done! Having the right mentors and role models also helps a lot! BFP: If someone wants to do what you do, where should they start? PM: Probably start by assessing the motivation behind what they do to see if they are following their passion. Be ready to change direction if what they are doing is not leading them where they want to go. Then, find a balance between the reality and their dreams to do better and have an “it can be done” attitude! Lastly, having a good network helps as this can open doors of possibilities! BFP: Finally; what do you hope to get out of being part of the BFP community? PM: I hope to connect with other BFP members interested in joining hands in order to strengthen the African innovation ecosystem. I am keen in collaborating with members from different African countries to see how we can mobilize innovators from their countries to participate in the Innovation Prize for Africa! I also hope to learn from the community members about what else we can do at the AIF to contribute more to the discussions and actions that would speed up the sustainable development of Africa.

20561,Isaac Lyne,https://businessfightspoverty.org/isaac-lyne,"IL: I&#8217;m located between Sydney and Cambodia, writing my PhD thesis on the role of social enterprise in local and regional development in Kampong Cham Province, Cambodia. I coordinate the capacity building program ‘Social Enterprise and Non-profit Management’ at the Royal University of Phnom Penh, Cambodia’s oldest and largest university. I&#8217;m also the coordinator of the National Social Enterprise Conference of Cambodia which has been running since 2011. BFP: What is the best part about your job? IL: Engaging with Cambodian mid-career professionals who work in the development sector, to promote new ideas for innovative and sustainable solutions to poverty, social exclusion and environmental problems. BFP: What have been your greatest challenges? IL: Communicating across culture. Social enterprise originated as a western concept in response to western welfare problems, it is not locally understood and put into action in the ways that might be imagined if we draw from the literature on social enterprise and social entrepreneurship. Also sustaining the project beyond the initial seed funding provided by the British Council has proven challenging. BFP: How have you overcome these challenges? / What advice, would you give to others? IL: Challenges have been addressed by illustrating key concepts with locally understood examples and working group exercises to examine local examples and deliberate on whether these examples support a concept which has originated in a different cultural context. Field trips and study tours and stakeholder involvement in the formulation of conference activities have become an important addition to capacity building. I have become more successful in my work as I have spent more time in Cambodia and more aware the social arrangements which impact on the role social enterprises can play in local economic development. The amount of time spent in Cambodia has also fermented strong relations with a range of agencies in the country and has made it possible to transform the social enterprise project and the national conference into a sustainable, on-going mixed resource entity capable of gaining corporate as well as donor support. My advice is that successful capacity building for social enterprise in non-western communities is built upon an in depth understanding of the local context and it might not suited to short term consultancy work. Moreover, in a different cultural context local examples are needed for the concept of social enterprise understood, it is not enough to simply translate the language. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do, where should they start? IL: Travel in the country where you want to work, read extensively from cultural literature, keep a journal as you go, be prepared to do a lot of work voluntarily where the insights that you need are not provided by paid employment and attach upmost importance to any opportunity to access local technical knowledge. BFP: Finally; what do you hope to get out of being part of the BFP community? IL: Being part of BFP gives me a broader insight into the discussion on social business. New initiatives and areas where I lack in are bought to my attention, horizons are broadened for poverty reduction, social inclusion and solutions to environmental problems and I hope to gain new contacts that can leverage resources in this direction in Cambodia.

20565,Niels Dyrelund,https://businessfightspoverty.org/niels-dyrelund,"BFP: What do you do? ND: I am a Master’s Student of Business &amp; Development Studies at Copenhagen Business School (CBS), in Denmark, and a Research Intern at the United Nations Development Programme’s (UNDP) Istanbul International Center for Private Sector in Development (IICPSD), in Turkey. IICPSD is a global focal point in the UN system which focuses on the role of the private sector in human development. The Centre was recently established to promote actionable partnerships with the private sector for the accelerated completion of the Millennium Development Goals and for the world’s sustainable growth beyond 2015. I am about to start working on my master’s thesis and am therefore in the process of reaching out to a case organization, preferably in Latin America. BFP: What is the best part about your job? ND: The best part of my internship at IICPSD is my dedicated, inclusive and inspiring colleagues, our dynamic working culture, our meetings with internal and external partners and other stakeholders and the variation of topics. I like that I get to work with various topics that all deal with leveraging the strengths of the private sector for human development. It really complements my studies, and I feel privileged to be part of this as a graduate student. I would like to use this opportunity to encourage all organisations in the forum to engage with students in internships. At the same time, I am enthusiastic about supporting the collaboration between IICPSD and CBS Sustainability Platform towards a joint research project on the development impact of the private sector. BFP: What have been your greatest challenges? ND: I get to work with different disciplines, fields, areas and topics. This means that I often need to develop a quick but sufficient understanding of complex issues that I am little familiar with from the outset. The products that I work on are sometimes innovative, and they are often dealt with by a variety of organizations worldwide. The innovative nature implies limited prior knowledge, high uncertainty and the need for careful coordination with what already exists; and the diversity of organisations to engage makes it challenging to get a satisfying overview and implies high transaction costs. The global development agenda and the market-born solutions to poverty, inequality, social exclusion and progressive deterioration of the environment are complex topics, highly debated nowadays, for which my contribution to the specific work of the IICPSD requires substantial documentation. BFP: How have you overcome these challenges? / What advice, would you give to others? ND: In order to familiarize myself with a new area, I tend to first identify and consult the most influential organisations within that area and read academic literature reviews. In order to develop a sufficient understanding, I consult my colleagues frequently, and we draw on a network of experts. On the issues related to innovation, I assess the need for the ideas and how the ideas fit into existing activities targeting the same stakeholders. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do, where should they start? ND: Being from Denmark, I was first exposed to some of the realities of the Global South while I was an exchange student in Peru with the American Field Service (AFS), 15-16 years of age, living with a Peruvian family and attending a Peruvian school for a year. I think that this exchange experience was the first to draw my interests towards international development. My entry into working with the private sector in development has been through my business school: an undergraduate in business, language and culture (BLC) and a graduate combining business and development studies. Moreover, I have engaged in extracurricular activities in student organisations within the area of sustainable development, oikos and 180 Degrees Consulting at CBS, also mentioned in CBS’s recently published UN PRME report. My studies directly address the interfaces between the private sector and development. However, there are many entries into this area, which I think reflect its interdisciplinary nature and its demand for both practical field experience and theoretical knowledge. My colleagues at IICPSD have different backgrounds, including economics, business strategy and administration, international relations, finance and psychology. BFP: Finally; what do you hope to get out of being part of the BFP community? ND: I hope to network with community members and stay updated on topical issues; I find the online discussions and the blogs interesting and easily accessible, and I find the newsletter very useful. I hope to find more engagement of students as well, for instance through thesis collaborations. I also believe I can contribute to the wealth of knowledge and experience of the BFP community with what I have learned with the IICPSD.

20569,John Paul,https://businessfightspoverty.org/john-paul,"BFP: What do you do? JP: I’m currently a knowledge and communications consultant for infoDev, a global partnerships program within the World Bank that supports innovative and growth-oriented entrepreneurs. The program develops and implements scalable programs specifically targeted for mobile, climate and agribusiness enterprises. BFP: What is the best part about your job? JP: The non-stop opportunities to learn and apply that knowledge in creative ways. The rapid advancement of information and communication technologies continuously expands the boundaries of the possible, for the entrepreneurs developing new and innovative business models, for the business incubators and other platforms supporting them, and for people like me who help to capture and disseminate enabling knowledge. It’s an exciting time to be working in this space! BFP: What have been your greatest challenges? JP: Working as an independent consultant provides a lot of flexibility, both in terms of location of work (I primarily telecommute), and the scope of work. The trade-off is a lack of work stability. Budgets and priorities constantly shift, and that can be stressful at times. BFP: How have you overcome these challenges? / What is the secret of your success? JP: Never stop expanding the knowledge and skills you have to offer, and always be looking for ways to add value beyond what’s expected. Like any client-focused industry, it’s important that people are happy with your work. Having intrinsic motivation for the work that you do goes a long way to making sure that happens. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do, where should they start? JP: My path has not been a straight one, so I don’t think it matters as much where you start. Rather, it’s more important that you’re always taking steps forward. Know what you want to get out of each challenge you face, and don’t be afraid of getting out of your comfort zones. Given how rapidly things change, it’s important to be adaptable, so the greater the diversity of experiences you have had, the more able you are to be a solution to someone’s problem. BFP: Finally; what do you hope to get out of being part of the BFP community? JP: The evolution of ideas, and the language and frameworks that underlie them, is a fascinating thing to observe and an exciting thing to contribute to. The BFP community provides a great opportunity to do both. Editor&#8217;s Note: Thank you to John Paul for taking the time to do this interview. We&#8217;re always looking out for members to feature.

20571,David Smith,https://businessfightspoverty.org/david-smith,"BFP: What do you do? DS: I lead a business network for Diasporan business leaders in the UK. We are involved in bringing forward strategies that draw people together and reverse the fragmentation that is so often a feature of Diasporan society. There is a lot of hard work being done by many people working in small groups, with very limited resources. British African Business Alliance seeks to add value to each of them by sharing the work they are doing with a larger diaspora audience. I believe that it is by sharing knowledge, creating wealth and stimulating well-being that Africans will begin to create a continent that can really deliver for its children and the rest of the planet. BFP: What is the best part about your job? DS: Meeting people and understanding what they are doing; then helping them, when possible, to achieve their objectives. There is a lot of talk involved in the development of Africa, which is to be expected when people have limited resources and do not know how best to proceed – they want to be sure before committing money. So, when we get to doing deals that is very exciting. We are told we are the largest supplier of leads to one of our members and with an average order of between £5,000 and £10,000, we know we are making a contribution. Our largest project currently is a signed MOU on a $100m project in West Africa. BFP: What have been your greatest challenges? DS: Running a business in any economy is a challenge, more so at the moment especially, when it seems that there is no end of opportunity but in the UK we are at the wrong end of the telescope. Against a background of expansive growth in Africa, diasporans can be very conservative. A business network is not their natural environment and value for money is a constant question. All of which can be easily understood. The challenge is, with so much to do, matching those people with the ideas or opportunities with the funding to deliver their projects whilst knowing that inefficiency has a real and negative impact on the lives of those at the end of the line. BFP: How have you overcome these challenges? What is the secret of your success? DS: You have to deliver value. You have to have patience; and you have to make a conscious effort to bury the frustration when people who are slow to respond. My advice would be to communicate, clearly and accurately. Business is about people and I try to deal with individuals one on one, and then the wider membership as a group. No one has all the answers but I get a real buzz when a member with a problem shares it and in a short while another member provides a solution, it is great. I want to do this job and I think it shows in my attitude. I enjoy bringing forward successful solutions and sharing them with other people in a way that can positively improve the lives of disadvantaged people BFP: If someone wants to do what you do, where should they start? DS: I started with a blank piece of paper and wrote down the failings of all the business networks I had ever member joined. It was quite a lesson, although I paid my dues willingly, working out where I got real value from was not that hard. Taking a consumer’s view and looking at where the gap is important. A lot of diaspora networks are “Africa After Work” but actually that is no longer enough, so someone would need to sit down and design an organisation that creates new value for its members, which is what we have done. BFP: Finally; what do you hope to get out of being part of the BFP community? DS: Business Fights Poverty has been a great way of meeting people who are actively working towards creating a fairer world. BFP brings people out in a way that explores common ground and promotes best practise. BFP events create real links that have a lot of potential. When you are looking for solutions to particular problems it is good to start by talking with people who know and understand.

20578,Bill Royce,https://businessfightspoverty.org/bill-royce,"BFP: What do you do? BR: I work for Weber Shandwick, a global engagement and communication agency, and I focus on the cleantech sector (in its broadest sense, from renewables to smart cities and sustainable agriculture), energy systems and sustainability – which, for me, is about new value creation through long-term business transformation. That necessarily involves creating new business models with are green and inclusive, and develop capacity, skills, content and opportunities in the communities and countries where they operate – as well as positively doing no harm. We work for major global corporations as well as start-ups with novel technologies, not-for-profit foundations and NGOs. BFP: What is the best part about your job? BR: Working with really inspiring and committed individuals and groups: colleagues within Weber Shandwick, people working in our client organisations and their partners, or people in the many knowledge and best practice networks I belong to. Some of the best thinking on poverty alleviation and shared prosperity is coming from people in the corporate world and through think-tanks like Business Action for Africa – that is a major change over the course of my career. It’s also wonderful when you can help conceive and shape a development partnership and watch it flourish and deliver tangible improvements to people’s lives. BFP: What have been your greatest challenges? BR: To be honest, I am continually struck by the number of large corporations with significant operations in least-developed countries (LDCs) that simply do not have a cohesive development ethos or model. Two other major irritations are the disconnect between good corporate policies at the centre and poor implementation in the field (human rights springs to mind), and the temptation to do the right thing but with an inadequate investment to nurture durable change. I also get a little frustrated with some development NGOs that are still quite immature when it comes to working with business. BFP: How have you overcome these challenges? / What is the secret of your success? BR: To quote Po’s father in Kung-Fu Panda, “The secret is that there is no secret sauce”! The advice I would offer, based on my experience, is to play the long game, know your stuff, build a good personal network to keep you inspired and motivated, and learn to celebrate each small achievement as a positive step forward. Large corporations are slow to change their thinking let alone their practice. With some clients it has taken years to win acknowledgement that they can do their business differently without undermining the viability of resource projects, and then to help them ‘learn by doing’, usually starting with a pilot project. Know when and how far to push, when to retreat, when to bring in other voices and viewpoints, find and leverage allies in the business, and be creative and consistent. Above all: to thine own self be true. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do, where should they start? BR: I’m not about to offer career advice, as mine has been full of unexpected twists, so maybe it’s better to show how I arrived where I am. I grew up in Australia and in my teens became incensed about the appalling treatment of indigenous Australians, becoming a strong supporter of land rights and reconciliation. That led me into student politics, then into national politics working for The Liberal Party of Australia. I was then a lobbyist in the early 90s when sustainable development started to gain serious traction, and also represented indigenous communities fighting for native title to their traditional lands. I was media adviser to the Australian Minister for Health, who also served as Chair of WHO’s Western Pacific Region and Chair of UNAIDS. Since leaving Government, and especially since moving to London in 2003, I’ve increasingly worked with clients with international footprints. I do think you benefit from understanding public policy and having a commercial mindset in addition to a development ethos. BFP: Finally, what do you hope to get out of being part of the BFP community? BR: Learn from other people who are doing great things and building shared prosperity, find inspiration, and potentially identify opportunities to connect unmet needs with clients seeking a long-term partner. Oh, and make some new friends. Editor&#8217;s Note: Thank you to Bill Royce for taking the time to do this interview. We&#8217;re always looking out for members to feature.

20581,Rachel Wilshaw,https://businessfightspoverty.org/rachel-wilshaw,"RW: I am Oxfam GB’s lead person for labour rights in global supply chains. My role is to identify and disseminate good practice, through advocacy and advice work with companies. Something like 90% of the world’s jobs are in the private sector, so as an organisation committed to tackling poverty and suffering, including in the workplace, Oxfam must engage with business. Public campaigns such as Oxfam’s Behind the Brands (which aims to drive a ‘race to the top’ in the food and beverage industry) get a message out in ways that compel a response and brings companies to the table, somewhat irritated but nevertheless willing to listen. That opens up the space for a different type of engagement which is where my role comes in: outlining good practice from an Oxfam perspective, criticising business practices, hearing other perspectives, understanding barriers to change and highlighting tools and approaches that could help. This year I have been involved in three projects that have sat somewhere between ‘campaigning against’ companies at one end of a spectrum of approaches, and ‘collaborating with’ at the other end. They have resulted in three reports being published in three months: Labour Rights in Unilever’s Supply Chain: from compliance towards good practice, with Unilever; Understanding Wage Issues in the Tea Industry, with Ethical Tea Partnership and Exploring the Links between International Business and Poverty Redu&#8230;: Bouquets and Beans from Kenya, with IPL. All three projects have tackled problems with deep root causes, which even powerful companies cannot solve alone. They need the combined influence of competitors, suppliers, civil society organizations and governments to find solutions. That’s not comfortable territory for companies or NGOs, but Oxfam is learning all the time what works and what doesn’t in this arena. And the UN Guiding Principles provide a timely framework for the dialogues. BFP: What is the best part about your job? RW:The best parts of the job are the teamwork that comes from working with knowledgeable passionate people, and the feedback I sometimes get when I’ve been involved in something that has made a difference. For instance, in response to our labour study, the CEO of Unilever made a range of commitments, for instance to improve grievance mechanisms, minimise the use of temporary contracts and conduct a ‘sustainable living review’ in 180 countries. During the study, some workers also thanked the Oxfam research team whom they credited for the two wage rises they got in quick succession. And a recent email from Ethical Tea Partnership said that, following publication of our tea wages report that they are ‘now getting calls and emails from people within the industry and retail sectors who are impressed with what we have done and want to know how they can help implement the recommendations.’ This creates the momentum to improve the livelihoods of thousands of tea pickers in countries such as Malawi. BFP: What have been your greatest challenges? RW: Particular challenges I have faced recently in my work include: How to address issues in ways which challenges the company, while developing a level of trust with those individuals seeking to bring about changes in policies and practices ‘from within’. Another person has called this ‘being hard on the issue but soft on the individual’. How to get sensitive findings into the public domain in a way which is transparent and drives wider change, but does not penalise companies who are prepared to ‘raise their heads above the parapet’. That would deter others and we want more companies to face up to difficult issues. BFP: How have you overcome these challenges? / What advice, would you give to others? RW: Relationship management, negotiation skills, knowing when to hold out on a point of principle and when to seek common ground. The fact that I have commercial awareness as well as knowledge of development and human rights – I did a procurement qualification and was an ethical purchasing manager for a spell. Thinking hard about how to communicate something – will a graphic or story speak louder than words or stats? what is the development case and the business case? what will a company’s objections be to an ask and what is Oxfam’s push back? Talking to colleagues and senior managers to sense-check the judgements I make. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do, where should they start? RW: I joined Oxfam 26 years ago this week, with an English degree and six years’ experience organising art exhibitions; scarcely the most obvious route into an international development organization, but a perfectly good one. I am still grateful to the recruitment panel for looking beyond the specifics of my cv to the potential they saw. When I look at what the younger members of my team have in common, this includes a lot of personal drive, a degree in a broadly relevant subject, time living in a developing country, a spell as a volunteer, and a willingness to support others as well as act on their own initiative, and a desire for a steep learning curve in their own knowledge and competence. Oh and modest salary ambitions of course. BFP: Finally; what do you hope to get out of being part of the BFP community? RW: I see the Business Fights Poverty website as a kind of ‘professional community’ that complements Linked-In. BFP is a place where research and initiatives can be shared with others, with a fair chance of a thoughtful response. It is a common space for people, whether employed by companies, NGOs or governments who are essentially like minded, to share effective or innovative ways for business to fight poverty.

20700,Jeff Raderstrong,https://businessfightspoverty.org/jeff-raderstrong,"BFP: What do you do? JR: I work on a few communications consulting projects, but my primary work is through UnSectored, an organization I founded. UnSectored is a community platform for re-thinking social change. We host online and offline conversations to help our partners engage deeply with audiences, establish thought leadership in a specific area of social innovation and discover new ideas and perspectives on their work. Our conversations include a wide variety of ideas to surface all possible angles of the topic of interest. BFP: What is the best part about your job? JR: I really enjoy critical thinking. At its core, that is what UnSectored is all about: Taking a critical look at our world and determining what is working and what isn’t, as well as what we can do better. I enjoy meeting new people and talking to them about what they are doing, and each month on UnSectored we have a whole new issue to discuss with a new group of people to talk with. It’s great to meet all these interesting people and learn about why they are passionate about what they do. Ultimately, we hope that with UnSectored, by bringing together all these different people in the same place, we can redefine what change means and create a more sustainable and just society. BFP: What have been your greatest challenges? JR: Our biggest challenge has been to show people the value of conversation. In today’s world, people are too busy to do anything but talk and think about the specific issue they are working on. UnSectored tries to bring people out of their comfort zones and get them to consider different perspectives on their work and the world they live in. Our society is driven primarily by ego. It is hard for people to recognize that maybe what they are doing isn’t the full picture, and that others have something to say that could improve their work. BFP: How have you overcome these challenges? / What advice, would you give to others? JR: It is a constant struggle to continually bring people together around different topics related to social change. It requires high-quality content that piques people’s interest, as well as a foundation in respectful dialogue and understanding. By creating a safe space for conversation, we can bring in people we may not have been able to otherwise. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do, where should they start? JR: I got a great piece of advice recently: Figure out the question you are most passionate about answering, and do everything you can to find that answer. I am not sure yet exactly what that question is for me, but has to do with why we don’t work together more as a society. My advice to anyone is to find your question and pursue the answer in any way you can. BFP: Finally; what do you hope to get out of being part of the BFP community? JR: I hope to connect with BFP’s diverse community and bring them into our conversations. If you want to check out what we’re doing, visit us over at http://www.UnSectored.net.

Hand in Hand’s goal is to create 10 million sustainable jobs by 2020; the total so far is 1.3 million, the great majority in India, led by a dynamic Hand in Hand India. BFP: What is the best part about your job? GS: Working with committed colleagues to support self-help within marginalised and excluded communities which will allow them, mostly women, to gain the skills and confidence they need to develop and grow their own businesses. And then in seeing how they use their earnings to lift the burden of poverty from their families. BFP: What have been your greatest challenges? GS: Overcoming indifference, bridging the gap between public rhetoric and action, whether from Governments, officials or the private sector; unlocking sources of finance that can underpin solid multi-year investments. BFP: How have you overcome these challenges? / What advice, would you give to others? GS: By being increasingly able to demonstrate success; being accountable for results, showing the difference that can be made; by being business-like and efficient; better communication, by listening to clients and to donors. More than half of Hand in Hand’s funding has come from the private sector, corporations, individuals and foundations. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do, where should they start? GS: There is no single or preferred path: I got wide experience through the public service, with the African Development Bank, and as non-executive board member for the British Red Cross. Colleagues have come from the private sector, the third sector, and from academia. There is much greater movement now, the key is to make a start, spot opportunities to develop, and show you can deliver. BFP: Finally; what do you hope to get out of being part of the BFP community? GS: Exposure to new ideas, new approaches, and best practice. Hopefully to have the opportunity to forge new partnerships and alliances with businesses and individuals who share our commitment to creating jobs.

20707,Ravinder Kumar Agarwal,https://businessfightspoverty.org/ravinder-kumar-agarwal,"BFP: What do you do? RKA: I am Associate Program Director at TechnoServe India. I work with many private sector companies in two ways, viz. a) as part of developing and expanding their supply chains which benefit farmers, bottom of pyramid populations with direct connections and market linkages for their produce…I, along with team here, also facilitate farmers /producers’ entry into primary /secondary processing of their produce to get better remunerative markets, b) facilitating on ground implementation of CSR /food security agenda of the companies who are willing to support business models oriented development, one of which is farmers’ producer companies. I am currently on the forefront to support many producer companies of reasonable built and base to progressively become sustainable and profitable enterprises. BFP: What is the best part about your job? RKA: The best and most exciting part of my job is to work with producer companies and support them to overcome many challenges that they face in their internal organisation (governance, shareholder reach et al), in their business model (working capital, operating efficiencies etc.) and in their dealing with the markets (market linkages, leveraging relationships etc.). I think this work is pretty transformative for more than 2000 shareholder members for each producer company. The most exciting part is also the fact that work is currently equally recognised by private sector, policy and development stakeholders as of paramount importance. The intensity, scope and breadth of this work will only increase in the times to come. BFP: What have been your greatest challenges? RKA: Economic and social development is a complex phenomenon, requiring diverse actions, at different levels to work in tandem for it to happen effectively, for it to deliver results and so on. Obviously it requires time and patience for the results to happen. We can always watch out on milestones and observable trends and success indicators on the way. Working with corporate, it’s been challenging to work with a long term vision and timeframe. The projects get sometime designed for short duration for delivering kind of results that can only be expected in the long term. The ‘light touch’ models do not work anymore in development. In fact the ‘light’ goes out in these projects when intensity goes down. Long haul, medium to high intensity is probably what can lead to better results and can potentially unleash multiplier effects of the interventions. One more challenge is related to maintaining the thrust on bottom of pyramid populations. The challenge is more pronounced in corporate supply chain led projects than in corporate philanthropy driven ones. BFP: How have you overcome these challenges? / What advice, would you give to others? RKA: Well, constant education, interactions, and conviction building is important. The other ends of the spectrum i.e. corporate are also similarly sensitive to the issues of practicality of results and ‘inclusiveness’ of the development agenda. It takes enormous vision on behalf of a development organisation to work with private sector effectively i.e. in a win-win sort of way. The companies get what they are looking for and development organisation ensures that its own mandate is served well through businesses of the private sector organisations. The maintaining of balance and achievement of twin objectives (of both corporate and development) is easier said than done but is not impossible to think of and achieve. It does take resourcefulness, dynamism and courage of conviction for the development organisation to ensure high degree of corporate satisfaction and medium to high degree of development results. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do, where should they start? RKA: Well, ideally start where it all begins, i.e. at the design stage of the projects. Herein resourcefulness of ‘you’ should come into full play as you sometime have to use the power of persuasive words and sometimes have to put your foot down in terms of what is possible and what is not going to be possible. Corporate by their very nature are quite ambitious breed (which explain their passion and success in their business). They are similarly ambitious for the development results to follow in their two dimensional logic (input-output type logic is used very coherently in some of these discussions, e.g. if water-melon farmers are trained for growing seedless variety, how is that productivity and income can not improve). It’s a process of joint discovery, learning together and enriching the project design, that we need to facilitate. Corporate have brilliant minds and if harnessed well, and if they are on your side, then a great project and development outcomes are sort of guaranteed. BFP: Finally; what do you hope to get out of being part of the BFP community? RKA: It’s where I belong. After having spent more than one and half decades in social and economic development space, I am firmly convinced about the role of businesses in fighting poverty. It can come not only from inclusive businesses angle (where poor are either producers or consumers) but also from corporate philanthropic initiatives. I have been fortunate to be part of delivering team on both sides. There are enormous adjustments to be done to the agenda and initiatives of ‘business fighting poverty’ so as to make it effective and transformative. They are truly challenges to this process which can only be addressed through reflections on one’s and other’s experiences. The BFP community provides an opportunity to ‘plug in’ whenever required…in times of success and when you are ‘down’, kind of looking for doable solutions… Editor&#8217;s Note: Thank you to Ravinder Kumar Agarwal for taking the time to do this interview.

I work with communities in Africa to create Information Communication Technologies for Development (ICT4D) and ICTs for Agriculture (ICT4Ag), driven agricultural commodity value chain based agribusinesses, using a value chain model we have evolved over the years that we refer to as the Resource, Aquaculture, Value Addition and Agribusiness Knowledge Centers BFP: What is the best part about your job? KK: Sitting with communities and listening to them identify the constraints to their wealth creation potential BFP: What have been your greatest challenges? KK: Making agricultural value chain actors agree that the biggest challenge in their agribusiness development is lack of a collective business model of produce aggregation for linkage to the market and linking the same to organized and willing consumers. BFP: How have you overcome these challenges?/ What advice, would you give to others? KK: We use the value chain mapping models and through these seek partnerships with consumer outlets to provide the market, partner with development organizations and government to support our effort to bring smallholder producers together. We also support the creation of trust in farmer-owned agribusinesses by introducing ICT-based weighing scales to reduce cheating from buyers or clerks of their farmer organizations and from here create linkage to the market for either value added produce or aggregated raw produce. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do, where should they start? KK: VACID Africa is an NGO, founded and owned by ourselves. If someone wants to do what we do, they just take our constitution, adapt it to their environment and legal requirements, get our mentorship and make stakeholders link up. We are a network not a business entity, our focus is empowerment, so if someone takes on what we do we feel they are on a route to empowerment, which fills us with excitement. BFP: Finally, what do you hope to get out of being part of the BFP community? KK: Our model is to use agribusiness to create wealth for our stakeholders, normally impoverished smallholders. Our goal and that of BFP is the same, to create wealth or fight poverty are only the two sides of the same coin. We therefore will gain from the experiences of others, senior business people, small business owners, and policy and institutional partners who believe what we do. In the process we shall create goal oriented collaborations that influence our thinking as we also influence others to embrace our thinking and in the end benefit all those what we work with. Coming from a continent where transparency in business and community engagement is a challenge, we expect to infuse the use of ICT4D and ICT4Ag to straighten transactional engagement at all levels.

20712,Claire Hickson,https://businessfightspoverty.org/claire-hickson,"BFP: What do you do? CH: Trio Policy helps organisations improve the impact of their policy, advocacy and communications activities. My background working for the Department for International Development, the Commission for Africa and for international NGOs means that we have a strong focus on international development – including the role of the private sector in development through, for example, agricultural supply chains. BFP: What is the best part about your job? CH: The best part is when you can see the results of your work reflected in the policies and pronouncements of those you were trying to influence and helping clients solve problems. Some of our clients have huge expertise, but their size means not everyone knows who they are. I really enjoy helping them find the opportunity to tell key people more about their work. Other clients are bigger but still benefit from an external perspective to help them use their profile and capacity to greater effect. BFP: What have been your greatest challenges? CH: Advocacy is not all about either shouting or schmoozing &#8211; though both have their place. Sometimes people can get fixated on particular activities, whether it is meeting with a minister or mass email campaigns, rather than why they are doing something or what it is going to achieve. BFP: How have you overcome these challenges?/ What advice, would you give to others? CH: The key is to focus on impact and to start by thinking through what makes the people you are trying to persuade tick. Don&#8217;t make assumptions. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do, where should they start? CH: There is no one place to start. A range of experience can give you a more solid foundation and make life more interesting. Working inside government as well as with NGOs and the private sector, being an elected politician myself (I am a local councillor) and having worked in Africa have all been useful to me. BFP: Finally, what do you hope to get out of being part of the BFP community? CH: The role of business in development is a growing feature in development debates. BFP community gives us the opportunity to be part of that discussion. Editor&#8217;s Note: Thank you to Claire Hickson for taking the time to do this interview.

20715,Marzena Zukowska,https://businessfightspoverty.org/marzena-zukowska,"BFP: What do you do? MZ: I currently work as a media manager and strategist for Ashoka Changemakers. Breaking that down a little bit, I work to structure and organize online campaigns, bringing in the lens of social innovation to a number of different sectors through content, storytelling, and digital media. BFP: What is the best part about your job? MZ: Being in constant contact with extraordinary people! It is extremely rewarding to be able to offer an outlet and opportunity for visibility to some of the world’s most inspiring social innovators. And of course, the creative liberty and ability to empower others through writing and content. BFP: What have been your greatest challenges? MZ: Definitely bridging the gap between a virtual, online community and one that exists on the ground. Social innovators are not always the easiest people to track down! We are constantly asking ourselves the question – what can we offer these individuals online? How can our tools offer them something to keep coming back to? A personal challenge has been management – managing a team of people is a muscle that is strengthened over-time. Knowing how to do it well is an art. BFP: How have you overcome these challenges?/ What advice, would you give to others? MZ: The best way to overcome any challenge is to pull yourself out of isolation. Don’t focus on this as “your” challenge, but look at it in terms of the team you can build around it. Asking for help or advice from your colleagues is key to getting an “inside-outside” perspective. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do, where should they start? MZ: I would say be proactive and don’t discount your ability to think critically and creatively over the experience you may have in a particular field/sector. What’s more important than experience is the openness to take in constructive criticism and the desire to move fluidly through wide open spaces – the social innovation sector demands these types of skillsets. So begin anywhere and trust in your ability to learn quickly! BFP: Finally; what do you hope to get out of being part of the BFP community? MZ: The truth is, at end of the day, we can&#8217;t do and execute everything ourselves – we learn to trust in the power of the colleague, the network, and the community in order to make the kind of lasting impact we want to see. While the change starts with ourselves (the personal journey of the social innovator and that disruptive internal drive that makes us break with the status quo to find new solutions), the ultimate growth comes from community. This is exactly why I am most excited and intrigued by Business Fights Poverty: participating in a community of like and unlike-minded people, who wake up every morning with the belief that “business can indeed fight poverty&#8221;.

20718,Clare Jenkinson,https://businessfightspoverty.org/clare-jenkinson,"BFP: What do you do? CJ: I lead Business in the Community’s work on the UN Millennium Development Goals. Business in the Community membership based responsible business charity, the largest business-led charity of its kind, and so my role looks at inclusive business and private sector engagement with International Development, helping companies see the business opportunities in addressing global poverty. The work is championed by a group of business leaders, Business in the Community’s International Leadership team. My work includes advising and supporting companies, recognising best practice and using those examples to inspire others, encouraging business collaboration and providing a platform for businesses to learn from each other. BFP: What is the best part about your job? CJ: Hearing about all the different work that is being done in such a range of businesses, and working with the companies on our Leadership team that are really shaping the agenda in this space. It’s also incredibly inspiring when businesses come together to do something collaboratively, bringing different core skills and achieving something they couldn’t do alone. BFP: What have been your greatest challenges? CJ: It is probably convincing people of the importance of a business case for addressing development challenges, rather than a purely philanthropic approach. I strongly believe that is the only way to reach scale and sustainability, but there is resistance to this from both business and NGOs. Often businesses can be reluctant to be clear and transparent about their business case. BFP: How have you overcome these challenges?/ What advice, would you give to others?/ What is the secret of your success? CJ: Sharing the successes of when businesses are addressing development challenges with a solid business case, creating shared value. But it’s also important to recognise that initiatives such as these can take time and require a longer term investment, and require different approaches to business as usual. We’ve made business benefits central to how we recognise best practice through our International Award. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do, where should they start? CJ: I think experience of different sectors is important, understanding both the business and the development perspectives. It helps to be able to adapt your language depending on the audience. I actually got into the role with having a number of years experience of working with companies on sustainability and social issues, and I was also studying for a Masters in Development Management. BFP: Finally, what do you hope to get out of being part of the BFP community? CJ: It’s a great way to keep up to date with the other organisations that work with businesses on development, and identify new examples of best practice.

20721,Mary Mwangi,https://businessfightspoverty.org/mary-mwangi,"BFP: What do you do? MM: I am the Regional Chapter Coordinator- East Africa Chapter, Aspen Network of Development Entrepreneurs (ANDE), a program of the Aspen Institute. I coordinate the activities of the ANDE East Africa Chapter. ANDE is a network of organisations that support small and growing businesses (SGBs) within emerging markets. I support members who are working in East Africa by running programs that are geared toward creating synergy and strengthening the eco-system to support entrepreneurial growth in East Africa. BFP: What is the best part about your job? MM: ANDE members are very passionate about supporting small and growing businesses in the region, and the impact that has on the economy. The best part of my job is talking to members and learning about what they are doing in the sector and finding ways to support them. One of the main ways I am able to support these organisations is by making connections between them and facilitating collaboration. BFP: What have been your greatest challenges? MM: One of my greatest challenges has been identifying all the players in the eco-system and bringing them together. There are many organisations and resources in the region available to entrepreneurs. However the sector is disjointed with lots of replication of efforts. My goal is to create synergy in the sector to ensure that entrepreneurs in the region are able to make use of the numerous resources that are available to them. BFP: How have you overcome these challenges?/ What is the secret of your success? MM: The ANDE East Africa Chapter is launching a mapping study of the eco-system in East Africa. With this tool, we hope to begin to address this challenge. The secret to my success? There is no secret. I took time to really get to know myself, to get to know what makes me tick. I found the thing that gets me excited in the morning then I worked at it. My second piece of advice is, never stop learning. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do, where should they start? MM: I don’t think I can give you a formula. I just followed my passion. BFP: Finally; what do you hope to get out of being part of the BFP community? MM: This is a community of people who believe that enterprise can raise communities out of poverty. I hope to build alliances and find partners I can work with to strengthen the entrepreneurial eco system in East Africa.

20724,Viv Oyolu,https://businessfightspoverty.org/viv-oyolu,"BFP: What do you do? VO: I created and present the Dream Corner show which is dedicated to inspiring women of all ages to follow their dreams and passion. I interview female entrepreneurs, giving them a platform to tell their story, showcase their expertise and promote their business; as well as female leaders in the City to talk about their journey to where they are at the moment. The aim is to create the largest audio library of female leaders in the City. BFP: What is the best part about your job? VO: The best part of my job is the connection I make with so many remarkable women! You may think it’s not possible to connect with so many (interviewed over 200 and counting); but I do…truly an amazing experience hearing women’s stories – their journey. I have the best job for me! BFP: What have been your greatest challenges? VO: Dealing with last minute cancellations; as well as getting people to relax and enjoy the experience of talking about themselves. For some reason, women find talking about themselves a challenge. BFP: How have you overcome these challenges?/ What advice, would you give to others? VO: For the last minute cancellations, there’s really nothing you can do, but reschedule – assuming they want to. I learnt very early in to my career as a presenter that you can’t have an ego! It’s not about me, but my guest. I have to give them the confidence to relax and be themselves. For each interview, I send prepared Qs for them to know where I could possibly go during the interview, so they don’t feel ambushed! I have a very relaxed and conversational style of interviewing and that helps a lot. I am genuinely interested in all my guests – hard to believe but I am; and my guests will attest to that. About 80-90% of my guests have come through referrals – people enjoy the experience and tell others to get in touch. I am very fortunate I don’t have to advertise my show. Secret to my success? Apart from what I mentioned above, I listen intently to everything my guests say, and refer back to it – it shows I’m listening and interested. Also work hard to understand my guests sector to some degree, but I like/enjoy the ar of discovery during an interview. As a curious soul, it’s just magic! BFP: If someone wants to do what you do, where should they start? VO: My journey into radio has been very unusual to say the least! I have a degree in Marketing and an MBA; worked in the City and ran a Social Enterprise before I got into radio purely by chance some may say, but it was a 30-year old dream come true. I don’t have any form of training &#8211; everything I do is by instinct. This certainly is the easiest job I’ve ever done and love every minute of it! BFP: Finally; what do you hope to get out of being part of the BFP community? VO: I hope to connect with like minded people and support in any way possible – perhaps feature/interview female leaders or issues that concern women.

20727,Kavita Prakash-Mani,https://businessfightspoverty.org/kavita-prakash-mani,"BFP: What do you do? KPM: As Head of Food Security Agenda at Syngenta, my mandate is to develop and pilot innovative business models that deliver sustainable solutions for smallholder farmers and ensure the environmental sustainability of agriculture. We are running pilot projects in countries like India, Tanzania and Paraguay focusing on farmer needs for access to inputs, knowledge, information, finance and markets. We work with partners across the food value chain as well as with NGOs, donors and governments to develop holistic solutions that help smallholders increase their yield and profitability in an environmentally sustainable way. BFP: What is the best part about your job? KPM: I have always worked at the intersection of business and sustainability. What is especially exciting about this role is to be able to develop and deliver innovative solutions. And even more than that it is being able to see the results of your efforts on the ground in terms of higher productivity and profitability of farmers farming less than 2 hectares of land – the difference we are able to make in their lives is truly motivating. BFP: What have been your greatest challenges? KPM: The kind of models we are developing and delivering take time – time to develop, to set up, to bring in partners, to engage our own business and to deliver results. In a world where people are looking for quick wins and fast results, the slow pace of change for sustainable solutions can be a real challenge. BFP: How have you overcome these challenges?/ What advice, would you give to others?/ What is the secret of your success KPM: Patience and perseverance is my new mantra! It is important to ensure that these initiatives are set up right – and to take the time to do that. It is also important to keep all stakeholders engaged and informed throughout the process and to ensure that their interests are included. And it is important to highlight and celebrate even small achievements and milestones. It does help to have supportive bosses! BFP: If someone wants to do what you do, where should they start? KPM: I think everyone should start where they are. I am fortunate to have the opportunity and role I have. But I think it is equally important for people to feel empowered to create sustainable change from their current position – to think of possible changes they can create now, to bring new ideas to the organisation they are in, to create a community. We need a bottom-up, top-down, any-which-way approach to sustainability. BFP: Finally; what do you hope to get out of being part of the BFP community? KPM: The BFP community is a unique family of like-minded people focusing on one of the most critical challenges of our time. I get a lot of inspiration and learning from it and also a sense of belonging. I hope we can continue to grow the passion and determination that it embodies.

20729,Linzi Moore,https://businessfightspoverty.org/meet-linzi-moore,"BFP: What do you do? LM: I work for IMA International, a business delivering training, international development consultancy and coaching around the world. I lead design, delivery and business development for our capacity building services in subjects such as creating partnerships, leadership, soft skill development and more. We work exclusively with development professionals, whether they be from the UN, NGOs or the private sector. Our clients are my focus, so I am constantly reaching out to understand more about what their needs are, and ensuring that we are well positioned to respond. BFP: What is the best part about your job? LM: We work with consultants placed all over the world who are experts in their fields, and I love matching them with great organisations and watching the innovations and change that happens as a result – that’s job satisfaction for me. BFP: What have been your greatest challenges? LM: I used to work in the private sector in the UK, so when I first got into training in the international development sector I felt overwhelmed with the opportunities that were available. I am a naturally ambitious person, so it was tough to specialise and learn to say ‘no, that is not my/our area’ and pass opportunities on. However, as anyone in this sector knows, it’s impossible to serve your clients properly without doing this. BFP: How have you overcome these challenges?/ What advice, would you give to others?/ What is the secret of your success? LM: A consultant’s life is a hectic one, and so I really recommend taking on an activity outside of work that helps you relax. For me it was yoga, but for others it could be a team sport like basketball, football/soccer etc. It gives your mind a break and helps you get into new creative spaces, so that when you return to work the next day you are more focused. In terms of general success in this area, for me the network has been extremely important. Networking without a cause is pretty useless though – it’s got to be targeted networking that brings benefit to both parties. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do, where should they start? LM: I started by offering free trainings to charities in London, and going off to explore the coffee sector in Rwanda. I built a network of interest around that, and by the time this job came up I had the knowledge and training experience that I needed to place myself. I stand firmly by the notion that training can not be learnt from a book – you can gather some basics but the only real way to develop in this area is by doing it. BFP: Finally; what do you hope to get out of being part of the BFP community? LM: It is a great platform for me to understand more about what other companies are looking for, especially around my area of interest, which is cross sector partnerships. IMA will be running a course in Bangkok in May called Creating Successful Partnerships, so I am hoping to use BFP to keep reaching out with these types of opportunities, and to hear what else would be helpful.

SCM: I’ve been working at Palli Karma-Sahayak Foundation (PKSF) for four &amp; half years as an Officer (MIS Analyst). PKSF is an apex organization (not for profit) established by the Government of Bangladesh for poverty alleviation through employment generation and is one of the biggest microfinance organizations in Bangladesh. In addition to this, I am an active development worker and blogger on many international blogging societies and institutional sites where I get to share my views and thinking with others on a range of development issues. I am an active member of Business Fights Poverty and a Featured member of pro-act.org (an e-community of the World Bank Institute). BFP: What is the best part about your job? SCM:One of the best parts of my job is monitoring the workings of our Management Information System (MIS) and using the findings to motivate my colleagues to do their work more efficiently. I always enjoy going on field tours, where I monitor our countrywide micro credit activities, collect and preserve data as well as preparing Microfinance situation reports with our Partner Organizations (POs). BFP: What have been your greatest challenges? SCM: As an MIS Analyst my greatest challenges are ensuring the effective collection of real data from our POs who work on poverty alleviation through micro finance and thoroughly analysing the collected data and producing reports for future actions. Poverty alleviation through microcredit is tough but fruitful work, if it is implemented in a systematic and borrower-friendly way. Accurate and precise data analysis are an essential part of poverty alleviation through microcredit. Aside from my day-to-day role as a development worker, as a blogger it is my continuous challenge to express and spread my thinking and views to others and to learn from initiatives that are transforming lives. BFP: What advice, would you give to others?/ What is the secret of your success SCM: &#8220;In my childhood, when I was small, my legs were little, my field of vision was inadequate, but now I am growing up, my eye sight is plentiful, the little path which was so far for me then, now it is in the vicinity of mine… If I try, I can cross the line…and it is the secret of my success&#8221;. During my lifetime, so much of what I have learnt and achieved is down to my willingness to always learn more, even now my learning process continues. Believe in whatever you do. Aim to learn and gather as many experiences as possible. I would also recommend finding a mentor, someone who is experienced, whether he or she is the superior or subordinate, without any hesitation. Eagerness to know and learn &#8211; I believe self learning makes everyone confident. I have always believed that self learning and self confidence is the key to success. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do, where should they start? SCM: If you are interested in working in MIS or Data Analysis, you must be well educated, with an interest in IT-based work and also be a natural analytical thinker. I&#8217;d recommend taking a related degree or course. Gathering the data is only part of the role, you need to know how to use that data, for it to have value. To be a good development worker and blogger everyone should ensure they gain the relevant industry knowledge and experience. Also, read around the key issues &#8211; the blogs and articles of good bloggers and writers. BFP: Finally, what do you hope to get out of being part of the BFP community? SCM: Business Fights Poverty brings together and connects some renowned and expert professionals, development workers, entrepreneurs, businessmen, thinkers, learners, bloggers and article writers. Everyone can share their views, experiences, new ideas and learn from others. I hope it will continue to grow and add even more resources and play a vital role in world development work.

20735,Albert Tseng,https://businessfightspoverty.org/albert-tseng,"BFP: What do you do? AT: Business Call to Action (BCtA) is a global membership platform of companies, governments, and development organizations working to identify and promote business models that contribute to long-term commercial and development goals. BCtA members are market leaders and innovators, committed to developing commercially viable business ventures that engage people living at the Base of the Pyramid (BoP) as consumers, producers, suppliers, and distributors of goods and services. Business Call to Action is supported by the UNDP, which hosts the BCtA Secretariat, DFID, USAID, AusAID, the Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs, SIDA, the UN Global Compact, the Clinton Global Initiative, and the International Business Leaders Forum. As Outreach Consultant, I&#8217;m responsible for helping to expand the reach and scale of BCtA by engaging existing and new companies in the platform. Collectively, companies that are involved in Inclusive Business possess a wealth of information on how to effectively do business in low income communities, and the purpose of BCtA is to showcase these examples and share knowledge on successful business practices. BFP: What is the best part about your job? AT: Every day, I get to talk to very innovative business leaders at companies all around the world who are working on extremely impactful initiatives. I love business models and innovation, so it&#8217;s great to learn in so much detail about how these companies are designing and implementing their businesses in BoP markets. It is exciting to help build a community of like-minded socially motivated people, who are at the same time extremely focused leaders who are aggressively seeking growth of their businesses. When a member company learns something valuable that helps them be more successful, it is very rewarding because of the potential impact on lives at the BoP. BFP: What have been your greatest challenges? AT: It is encouraging that there are a growing number of Inclusive Business initiatives out there, but the needs at the Base of the Pyramid are certainly immense. Markets at the BoP are underdeveloped, so it requires a large set of actors including companies, governments, development organizations and non-profits to work together to build markets where everyone can be successful in their objectives. Definitely easier said than done! BFP: How have you overcome these challenges?/ What advice, would you give to others? AT: Since BCtA is supported by multiple development partners and has a membership of 65 companies and growing, BCtA hopes to be a good platform for businesses to connect with each other and other stakeholders to help them in their own specific individual business objectives, but also to advance the overall market for inclusive business. There are a lot of very good people working in Inclusive Business &#8211; the trick will be in how we all collaborate together to ensure that our collective resources are maximized. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do, where should they start? AT: I did a mid-career switch to development after spending many years in the private sector. Having that business experience has proven invaluable in my current role in understanding a wide range of business models, how companies work, and the incentives which can align the power of the private sector towards development objectives. BFP: Finally, what do you hope to get out of being part of the BFP community? AT: The BFP community has been an excellent way to learn about the approach of various companies and to connect with others working in Inclusive Business. The networking and learning opportunity on BFP is also valuable to me outside my consulting work with Business Call to Action, as I also provide advisory services to social enterprises, corporations, and development organizations in the areas of business strategy, economic development, impact investing, and inclusive business.

20738,Adrianna Logalbo,https://businessfightspoverty.org/adrianna-logalbo,"BFP: What do you do? AL: I am leading the Future Fortified campaign, a new initiative that seeks to raise both public and political will in the United States for improved nutrition for women and children around the world, particularly during the critical 1,000 day window from a woman’s pregnancy to a child’s second year of life. We believe that by mobilizing a new constituency of informed and engaged supporters for nutrition, we can drive focus and resources for improved nutrition, the basic building block for good health and well-being. BFP: What is the best part about your job? AL: The opportunity to be creative and bold for such a fundamental, critical issue for all of us. Nutrition, though widely understood to be important, has remained largely overlooked and completely underfunded within the global development agenda. We have an opportunity to make significant change in the coming years by educating new communities and advocating for better policies. It’s truly inspiring to be a part of this change process. BFP: What have been your greatest challenges? AL: The dual nature of nutrition – that it can be both hidden and everywhere all at once. Clearly nutrition matters to each of us in one way or another, as we think about what to eat for lunch and what to feed our families for dinner. Many of us are even supplementing our nutrition with vitamins every day! And yet when it comes to global nutrition, the issue has remained hidden, stuck somewhere between what are seemingly more urgent issues of hunger and obesity. Somehow we need to make it clear that nutrition IS urgent; that poor nutrition early in life prevents children from reaching their full potential and is a limiting factor for a number of our global health and development priorities. And make this compelling and actionable for individuals who are thinking about nutrition in their own lives every day. BFP: How have you overcome these challenges?/ What advice, would you give to others? AL: We’re still working on it! I believe people do want to get involved on global nutrition, we simply have not packaged the issue in a way that is both accessible and compelling to them. I would love to hear from others; both those in the nutrition community and those outside of it. Above all, I am open to learning from others to find what works best and collaborate. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do, where should they start? AL: I always tell people that there is no one path, which may be a bit discouraging or empowering depending on your perspective! For me, it was about being open to opportunities as they presented themselves early in my career, such as contributing to the creation of the Nothing But Nets campaign and subsequently leading the campaign. I now have the opportunity through Future Fortified to take all those lessons and experiences to the nutrition community to build an educated and active constituency for this issue. Several individuals – who have become mentors – have been a huge part of my personal path. I think it is important to both seek out and be open to these mentors as you may find them in various aspects of your life. BFP: Finally; what do you hope to get out of being part of the BFP community? AL: I am thrilled to be a part of the BFP community to connect with and learn from others, particularly those with different experiences and perspectives. I think the BFP community provides such a space and I am looking forward to leveraging that opportunity even more in the year ahead.

20741,Stephen Vance,https://businessfightspoverty.org/stephen-vance,"BFP: What do you do? SV: I am a project developer and design-builder focused on renewable technologies and consult on a variety of projects related to renewables. I am currently Project Director for Resource Conversion – Burkina Faso, a private collective of very talented people concerned with sustainable rural development. I have also co-written software and installed hardware systems that enabled remote monitoring and troubleshooting of renewable energy installations, envelopes, and boundary conditions to determine kilowatts in and out. BFP: What is the best part about your job? SV: The creative process of designing and developing for a win-win situation is always a very stimulating environment for me. Where before there was nothing but a need, followed by an idea, and to then see a built solution is what it’s all about. Then it’s off to gather the resources. BFP: What have been your greatest challenges? SV: Finding my people and then finding the money. In that order. Alone one can do very little, but with good experiences behind you it is far easier to attract talent. On the other hand, Capex sources do not fall out of trees. You have to find them, and today, post the financial collapse, it is incredibly difficult – you have to be very creative about it. We tried a crowd-funding campaign that brought almost no results. I really wasn’t expecting that and thought Resource Conversion was laid out quite clearly, but quickly came to realize we were competing with tech gadgets and postings about sick pets. The project also got a lot of pushback on the resource-as-project-finance structure that we were dealing with which was artisanal gold. Anyone with a world encompassing social view understands the negative complications of minerals and precious metals mining in Africa, but the question is, “Does it have to be so”? We say no! And we believe that definitively. Our approach is to safely and legally assist the artisanal production community so that it is their environment and they who directly benefit from the resources that they own. Then, through further assistance and technology transfer, that the subsequent innovations in community development are initiated by the community themselves. Some reactions were as if we touched the third rail, but nothing will improve without positive, researched, and thoughtful action. These things can be done. They just have to be implemented, monitored, and measured. Crowd-funding would be fine as a source if these organizations or supporters weren’t so focused on gadgets. Perhaps the supporters assume that there are enough charities to pick up the social crowd-funding need, but without localized business and trade involved, permanence suffers. There seems to be some pervasive fantasy that gadgets are the solution for all our problems. If someone comes up with a perpetual motion machine – sure, but that’s impossible in this universe so far as we know it. This is a very western approach, where we love our gadgets and our band-aids and eschew the interactive human element on the ground. That’s where the real work and permanence is. We have to get beyond this nonsense and realize that it is not the gadget alone, but the ability of the community itself to harness its own creativity that will enable the community to make the best and wisest use of its own resources. In the developing world, these resources are in abundance. Getting them to market at world market prices, without corruptive influences or damage is a part of the story, but I believe it can happen. So excuse my verbose answer – but the challenge is in the doing. The believing is easy. BFP: How have you overcome these challenges?/ What advice, would you give to others? SV: The struggle with the challenges is on-going. What I realised early on is that I needed to find a language to describe the process of Resource Conversion that is truthful, but that doesn’t threaten other’s world view of economics. I say this because the concept of Resource Conversion must take place in a highly equitable fashion that challenges the very foundation of capitalism, at least the insidious runaway version that has brought nearly every common citizen of the developed world to their knees. Perhaps it was necessary so that the mass of the people understand the depth of change that is needed everywhere and acquire the bravery to speak this new language in first person terms. So, I must say that we are “intending” to be successful at this. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do, where should they start? SV: Humanity is like a giant fabric spread across the bottom of the troposphere. We’ve crossed the Rubicon of climate change and we’re all connected in this issue. A spark way beyond your view somewhere will get to you. Start with that understanding. BFP: Finally, what do you hope to get out of being part of the BFP community? SV: I hope that being a part of the BFP community will illuminate new methods to get the tools of development to those that don’t have them so that they can define their own self-sufficient path. To that end, contacts are important. Insight into what others are doing and their thoughts is also important. Editor&#8217;s Note: Thank you to Stephen Vance for taking the time to do this interview.

20744,Ewan Robinson,https://businessfightspoverty.org/ewan-robinson,"BFP: What do you do? ER: I have a diverse role: as my title suggests, I collect and analyse information for a multi-year project on food value chains. I also work to make sure the project connects with the businesses, agencies, NGOs and consumers that can change the food system. Our goal is to find ways to make nutritious, healthy foods accessible to people affected by undernutrition, especially poor consumers in several African countries. We are creating tools for donors, businesses, governments and NGOs to understand why value chains are failing to deliver these foods, and where intervention could make a difference. A big part of this is finding ways to incentivize businesses, from small ‘kitchen enterprises’ to multinational companies, to sell the right foods at affordable prices. As more people eat processed foods, it means getting information to consumers on what is in foods and what this means for health, especially for infants and children. The project covers a lot, and that’s what makes it exciting. I do much of the day-to-day of work of gathering information, conducting interviews, synthesizing reports and studies, and analysing data. I also help build collaborations with partners to connect the research with organisations in the sector, and to target our analysis and recommendations. I play a role in visioning, developing strategies and managing the project as a whole, and contribute to the nuts and bolts administration. One of the things I like best about my role is talking about the research with outside audiences. I blog here at BFP and at Globalisation and Development. It’s a useful reality check to talk about my work outside the research community. BFP: What is the best part about your job? ER: One of the great things about doing research is that it can surprise you and challenge ideas you take for granted. I enjoy learning about real events and people – they’re always more complicated and more interesting than the assumptions you start out with. At the Institute of Development Studies, I get to work with people who bring all kinds of experiences, like advocating with policymakers, implementing programmes and working with the media (and social media). It’s a great environment for learning about – and putting into practice – how research can help change what’s happening in policies and organisations. I like working with different people to make research impactful and relevant to new audiences. For me, relevance connects to activities blogging, talking with all kinds of people during field visits, contributing to forums like Business Fights Poverty, and even linking research to theatre projects I’ve worked on in my spare time. I also love travelling, especially spending a few weeks somewhere, and having time to explore and meet people from different walks of life. I’m working in Ghana and Nigeria so far. My job lets me ask interesting questions, plus I learn about everyday culture, politics and food. I think learning about – and learning to eat! – new foods is without a doubt the most fun I have in my job. BFP: What have been your greatest challenges? ER: When I started this job, my role didn’t have a huge degree of structure compared to my previous roles. I knew we had to provide innovative and relevant research, and try to influence policymakers, businesses and practitioners. But how would we get there? I’m learning I have to be strategic, creative, and adaptive. For researchers who split their time across a number of different projects, it can sometimes be challenging to maintain momentum on many fronts, especially under intense time constraints. Since I work on one project, I get to concentrate my efforts. Still I need to focus on our objectives and mobilise the expertise of other people in the team. As we talk with different kinds of players in food value chains, we’ve found it can be tough to get the attention of businesses. Of course, it’s obvious that businesses are focused on the bottom line, and have many demands on their time, including from the development community. Convincing them that value chain research can open up new opportunities is a challenge. It’s crucial to engage wherever we can; we also need to recognize that at the end of the day people will have different stakes in the outcomes of our work. BFP: How have you overcome these challenges?/ What advice, would you give to others? ER: I mentioned that it takes creativity to connect research with action. It also takes clarity and coordination. I think it is vital to get a project team – including researchers, coordinators, communicators – engaged in serious discussions about how the research contributes to the change we want. These exercises are often required by funders, but I think we can go beyond what fits in management reports. This can involve difficult conversations; going into the details reveals that people have different ideas about what needs to happen. But I think having these conversations early on in a project can foster respect, transparency and effectiveness. It can make the job exciting and play to people’s different strengths. To be honest, the second challenge, connecting with businesses, is something we are very much working on right now. As we investigate how to foster specific food products in Ghana, we are trying to anticipate the concrete outcomes our work can offer for businesses. At the same time, we have to contribute to other stakeholders and our research is a public good. We are drawing on the IDS Globalisation Team’s ongoing partnership with the Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition, an organisation with a strong record of working alongside businesses. We’re thinking about ways to share and get feedback beyond conventional research reports. This is very much a work in progress, and we’d love to hear from other Business Fights Poverty members! BFP: If someone wants to do what you do, where should they start? ER: Many paths can lead to a career involving research, especially at a hybrid organisation like IDS. I have colleagues with backgrounds implementing projects for NGOs, lobbying for policy change, practicing law and doing analysis for businesses. Of course, a graduate-level degree with a strong research component helps. So does experience working abroad, setting your own agenda, working independently and applying a set of research methodologies. The standard advice applies about gaining experience, taking on internships or short consultancies and persevering if you don’t get the position you want at first. I don’t think a degree alone will ever be enough for doing good research. Be curious in whatever you do and ask yourself tough questions, even if this isn’t your job. I think you can gather skills and insights in almost any job that will help give you a unique perspective as a researcher. BFP: Finally; what do you hope to get out of being part of the BFP community? ER: As a member of the Globalisation Team at IDS, I get to work with people who have a huge body of experience on businesses in development. That’s how I found out about Business Fights Poverty: the Team has collaborated with BFP to bring together great thinkers. BFP founder Zahid Torres-Rahman talked about how business impacts development at IDS and IDS’s John Humphrey was part of a BFP panel on harnessing value chains for nutrition. For me participating in Business Fights Poverty is about learning who’s working on the issues and how they’re thinking. It’s been really helpful for me to get feedback and suggestions based on blog posts I’ve written, and to learn about others working on agriculture, food and nutrition. We all have many demands on our time, and it can be hard to participate in social networks as much as we’d like to. I think networks like BFP are at their best when they lead to new ideas and connections, challenge our assumptions and help us do our work better.

20747,Christina Tewes-Gradl,https://businessfightspoverty.org/christina-tewes-gradl,"BFP: What do you do? CG: I lead Endeva, together with co-founder Aline Krämer. Our aim with Endeva is to enable more and more effective inclusive businesses through research, knowledge transfer and consulting. Basically, we provide the knowledge for companies to include low-income people in developing countries into their value chains, and for other actors, in particular donors and national governments, to support these companies in their endeavour. We have looked at sector-specific models in the energy, insurance, pharma and agribusiness sectors, and we find that companies really value this kind of specific information, especially when it is combined with peer-learning opportunities, as in our trainings. BFP: What is the best part about your job? CG: I am independent and can pursue the issues I really find important. Through the inclusive business lense, I learn a lot about how societies work and how we can collaborate more effectively to improve them. I work with a lot of visionary and warm people. BFP: What have been your greatest challenges? CG: Moving beyond the research part to apply our knowledge and help to build real business on the ground has been our greatest challenge. Companies are often reluctant to pay for consulting and rather use public, free support. BFP: How have you overcome these challenges?/ What advice, would you give to others? CG: We are offering shared products, such as trainings or webinars, to reduce the cost for the individual company. We constantly review where we can have most leverage with our work. Currently, we are very interested in how policy makers can create conducive framework conditions and can thus enable inclusive business on a broad scale. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do, where should they start? CG: Me and many of my colleagues at Endeva have started with a PhD on an inclusive business theme. Being a PhD students gives you a lot of opportunity to go into the field, network with people, acquire solid research skills, and seek out the niche where you can add value. BFP: Finally; what do you hope to get out of being part of the BFP community? CG:In our projects, we always involve experts and practitioners in the process. We want to build communities around the topics we works on, so that, in the end, there is not just a publication, but people who want to use it, and momentum for further collaboration. I use BFP to look for experts for our projects. Editor&#8217;s Note: Thank you to Christina Gradl for taking the time to do this interview. We&#8217;re always looking out for members to feature.

20750,Nichapat Na Thalang,https://businessfightspoverty.org/nichapat-na-thalang,"BFP: What do you do? NN: I am the Senior Outreach Coordinator at the CSR Asia Center, based in our Bangkok Office. I am responsible for the overall visibility of the CSR Asia Center though partnership creation and outreach activities here, in neighbouring countries and in other LDCs in Asia. I will be particularly focused on the lead-up to the 10th CSR Asia Summit, taking place in Bangkok from 17th to 18th September 2013. My aim is to deepen and strengthen the Center’s focus on development and poverty alleviation. I work on responsible business strategies and innovative models for sustainable and inclusive development. BFP: What is the best part about your job? NN: To witness and experience with my own eyes the change of development paradigm and the increasing role of the private sector in addressing global challenges. My job gives me a chance to be part of the solution. BFP: What have been your greatest challenges? NN: To find a balance between the business agenda and development agenda by integrating them together and putting them into a practical solution. BFP: How have you overcome these challenges?/ What advice, would you give to others?/ What is the secret of your success NN: My favourite challenge is to foster win-win solutions for all stakeholders. It has to include enough of a win to encourage the private sector to include sustainability into their core business strategy. Above all, you need to have a good understanding about business and development objectives and be very positive and creative to design an action using partnership as a key. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do, where should they start? NN: If this is your passion then you will find the way. I started my journey in 2010 by having a conversation with someone from the private sector who strongly believed that the development agenda and business agenda would never share common values. But I don&#8217;t share that view: I believe in shared value and partnership. BFP: Finally, what do you hope to get out of being part of the BFP community? NN: I hope to be able to share and learn from everyone. And hopefully strengthen South-South relationships through knowledge and wisdom sharing. As we are organizing a summit this year in Bangkok, I will be looking forward to welcoming friends from the Business Fights Poverty Community to Thailand!

20753,Barbara Njau,https://businessfightspoverty.org/barbara-njau,"BFP: What do you do? BN: I am the Senior Reporter and Markets Editor of ‘Foreign Direct Investment’ (fDi) Magazine, which is part of the Financial Times Group. It is a bi-monthly publication, and I write articles and in-depth special reports that cover Africa, Asia and Middle East. I track these regions’ markets and I report on the business of crossborder investments. For this I interview political and business leaders, ranging from presidents and ministers, to CEOs and managing directors. I also represent fDi Magazine at international summits and conferences, acting as a speaker, panellist and moderator. BFP: What is the best part about your job? BN: Travelling and meeting all types of fascinating individuals. My work has taken me across the globe from some global destinations like Tokyo in Japan; Dubai in the UAE; to Nairobi, Kenya; Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; Seoul, South Korea; and Casablanca, Morocco. My job has also taken me to less well-known places. For example, I went to meet the president of Gabon in his palace in Franceville, Gabon; I met the finance ministers of Rwanda, Zimbabwe, Nigeria and South Africa in Arusha, Tanzania, and I interviewed some dynamic managing directors in Chengdu, China. I have met some interesting people along the way, made good friends, and tasted exotic dishes too! I enjoy public speaking and I have widely spoken on the business of foreign direct investment in several conferences. I spoke about Tunisia’s investment opportunities in Tunis, in the country’s first investment conference after it went through the Arab Spring uprising, and that was really exciting. I went back home to Kenya (where I am originally from) to speak at an Africa Caribbean Pacific Economic Zones convention in Mombasa and I enjoyed meeting some local players from the private sector. I have spoken at a host of other conferences around the world, and I have enjoyed every moment of it. BFP: What have been your greatest challenges? BN: Learning on the go has posed its challenges. I was relatively inexperienced in business reporting when I started my role. As my educational background is in Politics, it was very challenging learning and getting used to some of the economic jargon that I had to write about on a daily basis. It felt like I was learning a new language. BFP: How have you overcome these challenges?/ What advice, would you give to others? BN: Immersion. I went straight into it and just read it over and over again until my brain could process it, a little at a time. I drew this experience from another similar occasion. While studying Politics as a student at the University of Nottingham, I applied to study in Paris as an Erasmus student and I was successful. The excitement turned into fear when I got to Paris, and realised I could not speak a word of French. I chose to study in a French university called ‘Insititut d’Etudes Politiques de Paris’ (Sciences Po, Paris) as I have always wanted to speak French. I did not realise it would be so difficult but I faced the challenge head on. I read French children books, French magazines, watched French films (which I did not understand for some months), but my brain slowly processed it, and I left after a year conversant in the language, with many French-speaking friends. I applied the same principle when I started my current role. I read fDi Magazine and the Financial Times newspaper on a daily basis, Googled unfamiliar terms, read ‘Economics for Dummies’, and after a while I begun understanding it. If you want something, go for it. Do not be afraid of challenges, for you may surprise yourself if you persevere. Do not expect quick fixes either. It takes a while. Yet anything worth working for does not come easily. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do, where should they start? BN: My advice is if journalism is what you want to do, intern as much as you can at newspapers. If you cannot get into the big mainstream papers, go for the smaller ones. If you still cannot get into those, go for small the start-up student papers or the independent journals. If you still cannot get in, either start your own paper, or intern elsewhere. It is less about where you intern, and more about the experience and the skills you acquire, and how you can illustrate that you are hardworking, driven and entrepreneurial, in your own way. For example, I interned in two non-governmental organisations as a researcher in Senegal and Cameroon. This helped me get my big break, when I got onto an internship as an Editorial Researcher for another Financial Times publication called ‘This is Africa’. It was while I was there that I searched for opportunities and landed my role with fDi Magazine BFP: Finally; what do you hope to get out of being part of the BFP community? BN: I want to learn about how I can practically address Africa’s development challenges in my own way, as I believe one of the continent’s solutions lies in the private sector. Africa needs a larger private sector that can absorb more of its citizens, and teach them the skills that can make them move out of poverty, as well as grow their countries’ economies. I joined Business Fights Poverty as I want to learn more about this. I enjoy reading the articles posted and I want to learn more from the community, to see how the private for-profit sector can be harnessed to promote development, and make profits, on the continent. I am also interested in adding to the debate. I have a new book that is due for release called “Building Brics: The new scramble for Africa”. This looks at how Brazil, Russia, India and China are altering the continent’s investment landscape, and I question this much publicised concept of a “scramble for Africa”, by looking at whether the continent’s new partners are benefitting Africa. I present examples of corporates from each of these countries (i.e. China’s petroleum company Sinopec, Brazil’s aircraft manufacturer, Embraer, etc) and I illustrate how they are changing the continent’s business dynamics, through using current examples, which draw from my work and visits to the continent. This will be available on Amazon from next week. Editor&#8217;s Note: Thank you to Barbara Njau for taking the time to do this interview. We&#8217;re always looking out for members to feature.

20756,Nicolas Chevrollier,https://businessfightspoverty.org/nicolas-chevrollier,"BFP: What do you do? NC:I currently work for the BoP Innovation Center which provides an incubator space where private parties can develop their business strategies towards BoP markets in a multi-stakeholder environment. The center’s involvement in numerous BoP business development strategies enables us to capture, process and share learnings about market-based sustainable innovations. Ultimately, learning by doing allows us to accelerate the impact and scale of these innovations. As a programme manager at the BoP Innovation center, I manage a portfolio of inclusive innovations in the water, energy and food sectors. It implies initiating, building and nurturing partnerships with industrial partners, international organizations, public authorities, NGOs, private foundations, and social entrepreneurs. This function has diverse components like partnership building, business opportunity identification, implementation business strategies and securing adequate investment finance. BFP: What is the best part about your job? NC: Seeing every day the impact of these innovations and believing strongly that it features the future of our societies. Aiming at developing innovations with social impact and reaching financial sustainability at the same time give you this incredible force of doing good while being efficient and long lasting. BFP: What have been your greatest challenges? NC: One surely is the integration of diverse and apparently conflicting ideas (long term impact with short term financial return) and combining different organization DNAs (multinational companies with social entrepreneurs) to create impactful trajectories that deliver services and products for and with low-income groups. Dealing adequately with diversity is a key to success at the BoP but to handle this heterogeneity is also a significant challenge. BFP: How have you overcome these challenges?/ What advice, would you give to others? NC: It is interesting to reflect on this for me. Initially, I was trained as a telecommunication engineer and then as a researcher, later on I received executive education on social entrepreneurship. Right now I manage innovation projects at the intersection of business, innovation and development in the food, energy and water sectors so quite far from my original qualification. Along the way I have worked for a multinational corporation, a leading governmental laboratory, a knowledge institute and an NGO. These diverse experiences both in developed and developing economies allow me to do what I do today by having the necessary level of understanding or empathy of different viewpoints. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do, where should they start? NC: Firstly, be passionate. This is the one attribute that makes you go the extra mile. Secondly, picture the end and stay focused. I have always wanted to combine in my work business/innovation and development to reach impact. By being focused on this goal, I was able to make unusual career choices that do make sense ultimately. BFP: Finally; what do you hope to get out of being part of the BFP community? NC: The BFP community is a central point of knowledge and exchange for the work I do. At the BoP, due to major institutional or market constrains, one cannot innovate alone so I am constantly in search of new partners. Furthermore, we are still at the early stage of bringing this BoP/Inclusive business industry to maturity and to exchange on best practices is essential for me.

20759,Dr Siddhartha Sankar Dash,https://businessfightspoverty.org/dr-siddhartha-sankar-dash,"BFP: What do you do? SSD: I am an independent small business consultant based in Bhubaneswar, India. I have been working as a teacher, trainer, consultant and researcher in various parts of the world. Currently I am busy doing research work on the indigenous people of the Indian state of Odisha. Recently I co-authored a book entitled ‘Indigenous people and Entrepreneurship in Kandhamal’. The book is about optimizing Common Property Resources for the benefit of the indigenous tribes of Kandhamal for entrepreneurial growth. In India around 19% of the land comes under Common Property and to bring about inclusive growth, the only way out is to put this land to optimum use and legalize its use to benefit to the rural and indigenous people. The idea is to use this land for cultivation of medicinal and aromatic plants for the benefit of the indigenous people. BFP: What is the best part about your job? SSD: In all my roles, what I have always enjoyed most is motivating and training the youth to take up entrepreneurship as career a option through systematic entrepreneurship development programmes. Ultimately it is good to see the youth succeed in their business endeavors and contribute to the development of the nation. BFP: What have been your greatest challenges? SSD: My greatest challenge has been to design feasible self-employment generation projects for the local youth and also to find sponsors for them. I faced an even bigger challenge when I designed several skill developments and entrepreneurship development training programmes in Malawi for HIV/AIDS infected and affected women and was thrilled to see it become a great success. Empowering these women was itself a big challenge. The other challenge I faced in Dominica when I introduced a programme for the high school students under Catch Them Young. The idea was to expose high school students in the field of business and technical studies, to entrepreneurial and business education, as means of encouraging them to seek alternative avenues for employment creation and income generation. This programme is continuing with high school students in the Caribbean. BFP: How have you overcome these challenges?/ What advice, would you give to others? SSD: When you work with socio, cultural, economic and ethnic groups there are bound to be several challenges in trying to convince and motivate people. Yet I have been successful in overcoming these challenges by sheer grit, determination and belief in myself. For the last 23 years it has been hard work and determination and never loosing site of the goal. Being passionately involved in my work helped me overcome many of my hurdles. Constantly working with the poor and for the poor gives me a sense of pride and happiness. The smile on people&#8217;s faces is my driving force. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do, where should they start? SSD: If someone wants to do what I do, my advice to them is to first study entrepreneurship as a subject at graduate level. Next be passionately involved and be ready to work with the youth and be innovative in your approach, understand the problems and find quick solutions. BFP: Finally; what do you hope to get out of being part of the BFP community? SSD: It gives me immense pleasure to be part of the BFP community. BFP is one of the best platforms to share and discuss latest happenings in the field of entrepreneurship. By being a part of the BFP community, I am sure I would be able to share my knowledge and expertise at a global level. It is a beautiful learning and ‘feel good’ experience also.

I work at the World Business Council for Sustainable Development, which provides a forum for its 200 member companies to share best practices in sustainable development issues and to develop innovative tools that challenge the status quo. (You can read more about WBCSD here). I work with WBCSD U.S., Inc. to promote WBCSD activities throughout the U.S. as well as with the Development Focus Area on issues such as inclusive business ventures, providing access to energy and socio-economic impact assessment. This includes writing case studies and articles that highlight member companies’ contributions to the sustainable development of emerging economies to increase the visibility of WBCSD and its member companies and build energy around these initiatives. BFP: What is the best part about your job? KS: The best part of my job is knowing that the work I am doing has the potential to have a major impact on the future. I truly believe that there is a significant opportunity for the private sector to contribute to socio-economic development and to do it in an environmentally sustainable way. It’s exciting to know that I am playing a part in spreading the word about some of the great things companies are already doing in this area that will hopefully revolutionize this space. BFP: What have been your greatest challenges? KS: The international community has increasingly looked to the role of business in meeting the upcoming 2015 MDG deadline. To engage the private sector in a replicable and scalable manner, there must be a business case for intervention. Companies’ contributions should therefore go beyond philanthropy and promote inclusive growth. The greatest challenge has been aligning varied stakeholder interests to find and promote the synergies between development goals and a company’s core business operations. BFP: How have you overcome these challenges?/ What advice, would you give to others? KS: What makes WBCSD’s approach unique is that outputs are developed and road tested by its members to maintain the business angle and ensure that initiatives are company-driven from start to finish. Based on this, the best advice I can give would be to keep in mind that private sector sustainability initiatives cannot be imposed. They should be incorporated into core business activities and driven by the mission and values of the company. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do, where should they start? KS: I began my trajectory into the field of sustainable development by doing a unique MBA that focused on international organization (you can read more about IOMBA here), concurrent with a Master of Public and International Affairs degree. Building a strong foundation in both public and private sector affairs is essential to understanding the complexities involved in cross-sector collaboration and the importance of aligning stakeholder interests. Everyone will follow a different path, but starting somewhere you can gain an understanding of both the public and private sector is essential. BFP: Finally; what do you hope to get out of being part of the BFP community? KS: BFP brings together some of the most renowned professionals across different sectors and facilitates an open forum for sharing information and best practices in the area of development. By being a part of the BFP community, I hope to be able to share my own knowledge with regard to sustainable development while learning from other members and staying current on issues that are continually evolving.

20765,Germán Zubía,https://businessfightspoverty.org/german-zubia,"BFP: What do you do? GZ: I am a co-founder and CEO of LAB Open Innovation. The LAB is an independent organization based in Mexico launched in September 2012 with the aim to transform ideas into sustainable actions for social impact by creating a bridging space that promotes effective collaboration across multi-stakeholders. That is to say private sector, government, public institutions, social entrepreneurs, academia as well as civil society. All of this with the aim of maximizing social impact and connecting key problems with innovative solutions. In addition, I recently joined GDP Global, a strategic consultancy firm based in London that operate at national, city and regional level, in more than 70 countries and which is focus on providing strategic consulting services for economic promotion organisations in the area of foreign direct investment (FDI) and promoting other economic development projects. BFP: What is the best part about your job? GZ: I sincerely consider that one of the most gratifying things for a person is working on something that they are really passionate about. For me, finding a way to make a difference has always been the reason that gets me up in the morning and this is the best part of what I do. I enjoy the opportunity to talk to people and exchange knowledge and ideas in order to collaborate and solve together complex challenges. Sometimes we think that everything happening around the world are isolated issues that are not connected directly with us but history has been showing us time to time that links are everywhere and that now more than ever it is compulsory to get involved in solving development challenges. It is crucial to promote and enhance civil society’s involvement, to incorporate private sector expertise and resources and do investment in building capacity in order to achieve sustainable solutions. Supporting the creation of networks, sharing of knowledge and inspiring people to work together will definitely help to unleash the potential of collaboration and reach transformational solutions. BFP: What have been your greatest challenges? GZ: By far, one of the biggest challenges has been trying to develop local empowerment and spread the word about the benefits of collaboration and its impacts for sustainability. There is a pre-conceived idea about social and business as two antonyms or separated worlds, which constrains collaboration. However, little by little there are more successful cases showing that social business is a matter of fact and is possible to be profitable while facing local communities’ challenges as well as helping communities without being merely a charity and requiring a permanent fundraising strategy. Currently in Latin America, social entrepreneurship and innovation are critical opportunity areas which in some regions are linked to the lack of resources but mainly to weakened institutions and lack of involvement. The main challenge is to get people to collaborate across different sectors and generate innovative solutions. BFP: How have you overcome these challenges? / What advice, would you give to others? GZ: The focus needs to be on strengthening networks, investing on capacity building and creating social businesses, which should be profitable but with a tangible social impact, not just about philanthropic efforts. My advice would be to engage the most and best-qualified stakeholders as partners as possible, which for me is essential to success. But it is very important to provide accountability at any stage to avoid corrupt practices or any kind of misconception. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do, where should they start? GZ: Having real world experience can be very useful although I think having in mind what you expect in life is more important. There’re going to be challenges the entire path and at the same time, the knowledge acquisition never ends. What is important is being dynamic, adaptable and believing in who you are and what have you dreamt about and never forgetting the inherent responsibilities of social consciousness. BFP: Finally, what do you hope to get out of being part of the BFP community? GZ: Without any doubt meeting people who are passionate about how the power of business can be aligned with development objectives. I very much look forward to exchange different experiences, receive the communities’ feedback and share fresh ideas from different perspectives. I am sure that being able to work jointly and having constant interaction will definitely help to achieve better development results.

20768,Nicole Voillat,https://businessfightspoverty.org/nicole-voillat,"BFP: What do you do? NV: I lead the sustainability program globally for The Bata Shoe Organization, a family business established in 1894. In my role I am in charge of making sure that we produce and dispose shoes in respect of people and planet in our own factories, as well as in the facilities of our suppliers. In our efforts to lighten our &#8216;shoeprint&#8217;, this year we have carried out our first Life Cycle Assessment of 4 types of shoes we produce and introduced energy saving compressors as well as translucent sheetings on the roofs of our factories helping us to save more than 6500 tons of CO2, among other initiatives. I am also in charge of our community projects like the Bata Children&#8217;s Program, a Bata employees volunteer-led program focused on helping disadvantaged children in 26 countries where Bata operates. We also have a number of social enterprises, for example the Rural Sales Program in Bangladesh, where in partnership with Care we empower more than 2400 former destitute women in selling affordable shoes to the Base of the Pyramid (BoP) customers since 2005, and two gumboots /plastic shoes recycling programs run in partnership with local entrepreneurs in Africa. BFP: What is the best part about your job? NV: I actually like everything I do, from encountering the workers in our factories around the world to tackling challenging sustainability issues, experimenting in new areas. I like everything that allows me to plant seeds that will allow my company to become an even better citizen in the future. BFP: What has been your greatest challenge? NV: My greatest challenge is dealing with people within the company whose vision is only directed to the bottom line and the short term. BFP: How have you overcome these challenges? / What advice would you give to others? NV: Nearly all of us feel at odds with the organizations we work for at one time or another. I believe that to be successful, live your values and principle at work and move as much as possible the sustainability agenda within the corporate world, you need to be a so called &#8220;tempered radical&#8221;. These are people that successfully walk the tightrope between corporate conformity and activism driving their agendas towards transformational ends with incremental means. Passion, conviction, patience and courage is probably the magic blend. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do, where should they start? NV: Focus on your vision and never give up. Meet people working in CSR and sustainability, read books and magazines on the theme, engage in an executive MSc in Sustainability and Responsibility (Ashridge University, UK) or short courses (Schumacher College,UK) for example. Work in profit and non-profit, work in the field, get your hands ‘dirty&#8217;, discover the world, its multiple cultures and languages (I learned more than 8 and lived in 10 different countries around the world&#8230;) BFP: Finally, what do you hope to get out of being part of this community? NV: Get inspired by other initiatives and people&#8217;s experience in fighting poverty through the power of business and private-public partnerships.

20771,Lisa Wong,https://businessfightspoverty.org/lisa-wong,"BFP: What do you do? LW: I am a research analyst at Nikko Asset Management (Nikko AM), a global firm with over $154 billion of assets under management, focusing on Latin American economics and Impact Investment globally in the Fixed Income team. In collaboration with the World Bank, Nikko AM has set up funds to invest in so-called “green bonds” issued by the World Bank to finance projects that help reduce carbon emissions and/or help low-income communities alleviate adverse consequences of climate change in both emerging and developed countries. To date, such projects range from eco-farming in China, sustainable water management in Tunisia, to addressing deforestation in Mexico. Another significant benefit of the green bonds is that they offer the investor a choice – often investors have little knowledge or influence on how the bond issuer uses proceeds, whereas with the green bonds the World Bank is transparent on the types of projects it fundraises for. This is a significant step as borrowers in bond markets do not generally like to be tied or restricted to financing specific projects. The Nikko AM World Bank Green Bond funds are also unique in offering a mainstream product to retail customers interested in seeking a market-comparable financial return whilst contributing towards climate-change mitigation. The funds won the TBLI ESG Leaders 2010 Most Innovative Development in ESG Award. As the Europe representative of the Nikko AM Global Environmental Social Governance (ESG) Forum, I also work to increase our firm engagement in ESG and impact investing and look to expand our activity in green investing to other impact themes addressing bottom of the pyramid challenges. In my spare time I also co-run Women Advancing Microfinance UK (WAM UK), one of fourteen WAM networks globally. WAM UK works to advance and support women working and interested in financial inclusion and microfinance through networking and volunteering opportunities. Amongst many notable events, this year, we had the privilege of celebrating International Women’s Day with Professor Muhammad Yunus, who presented the Grameen UK initiative, and explained why microfinance can be an important tool against poverty in the UK. I regularly blog for WAM UK if you’d like to find out more about us, or follow me on twitter @lisavwong for more general information on sustainability issues. BFP: What is the best part about your job? LW: Traditionally, ESG and responsible investment have been synonymous with equity investments. However, the global fixed income market is almost double the size of listed equity markets, which suggests that there remains a large pool of relatively untapped potential to grow responsible or impact investment – which I find deeply motivating. I constantly work with and meet people with different investment objectives, from solely financial return orientated to completely impact-driven and I am thus lucky enough to be constantly challenged on how I think about responsible investing. BFP: What have been your greatest challenges? LW: The best part of the job is also the greatest challenge: responsible or impact investing remains only a small fraction of global bond markets. Working on how best to engage others and invest for financial return and positive impact, appropriate to the investors and end-beneficiaries involved, is a tough nut to crack. Although I am strong advocate for more responsible capital markets and the role of impact investment within that, I also strongly believe in the transformative power of philanthropy and that both charity and investment have significant roles to play in addressing the problems of our world today. BFP: How have you overcome these challenges? / What advice, would you give to others? LW: Think big, but be as pragmatic as you can. I am a believer in building on small wins and doing as much as you can with what is available to you to meet larger goals. If you would like to be working in a more sustainable capacity then take action on that – perhaps you work for a firm that is not aligned with your own values but include it into your work to the best of your ability. For example, if you are in an investment research team in an organisation that does not have ESG filters in place could you introduce it into your work, and then perhaps encourage others to do the same? Or perhaps you could share your financial skills with a social enterprise or charity to foster sustainability outside your work place. Building consistency and track record is crucial to your own thought process and ability to reach more ambitious goals, such as designing an innovative impact investment product to address a global health challenge. It’s also easier if you work with others, be receptive to new ideas and try to collaborate where possible. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do, where should they start? LW: Develop understanding of both financial and impact investing – you need both. It may be that you have to focus on one area at a time and build up professional experience in each, but it is the ability to look at investment from both lenses that will grow responsible capital markets. Volunteering is also a great way to build up your skills and share what you have with causes you believe in; networks such as WAM UK and Finance Matters, both based in London, are useful for that. There are also great resources on the web such as the GIIN and books on responsible capital, for example, Impact Investingby Anthony Bugg-Levine and Jed Emerson. BFP: Finally, what do you hope to get out of being part of the BFP community? LW: I’m particularly focused on how debt markets can play a larger role in addressing our development and climate challenges, so please reach out if you have any thoughts on the matter. Above all, I hope to connect with like-minded people and share information on market-solutions to poverty and climate change. If you’re interested in microfinance and financial inclusion and based in the UK, I’d also likely to warmly invite you to join some of our WAM UK events.

20774,Jodie Thorpe,https://businessfightspoverty.org/jodie-thorpe,"BFP: What do you do? JT: I am a Private Sector Policy Advisor with Oxfam GB. This means I am responsible for helping Oxfam to understand the relationship between business and poverty reduction. I also work with other colleagues to influence companies, government regulation and the overall agenda on the role business can play, in terms of either doing less harm or doing more good, when it comes to the livelihoods and the lives of people living in poverty BFP: What is the best part about your job? JT:It may seem cliché, but the best part is that I work on issues that I am passionate about and hopefully make a difference to the livelihoods of other people. I enjoy the opportunity to go out and talk to people- meeting a smallholder farmer or a woman who has overcome challenges to feed her family- you could say that’s what keeps me going and gets me up in the morning. However, there is an intellectual curiosity as well, in trying to pick apart complex issues. We know that there are many problems around poverty that have been around for a long time and are often deeply entrenched. But how do we pick them apart and identify the causes? And then identify what can be done to change them? BFP: What have been your greatest challenges? JT: From a policy perspective one of the biggest challenges is trying to understand a company’s supply chain linkages, its impacts on people living in poverty and how these can best be addressed. And then in turn, how we can influence the company to change. At Oxfam we see the fundamental role that business needs to play if we are to tackle poverty and inequality. However, we also see that often some of the very decisions that business are making are causing the problem. You need to work on both sides. You need to work with the leaders that are really showing the way, raising the bar and looking for different ways to do business. At the same time we what to challenge these companies where we think they are part of the problem or they are not doing well enough on certain issues. It can be a challenge to differentiate between efforts made by companies that are really about their business model and core operations and those that are just tweaking at the edges or even worse- it’s all PR spin and actually there is very little happening. That’s a huge challenge separating out what is PR and what is real change or at least genuine attempts towards change. There is a lot of cynicism about companies and what they are saying versus actually doing on environmental and social issues. Messages from these powerful PR machines can undermine the good others are trying to do. BFP: How have you overcome these challenges?/ What advice, would you give to others? JT: In terms of trying to separate out those companies who are simply spinning a PR campaign and those that are making real efforts towards change, I would look out for a number of things: 1) The focus needs to be the company’s own operations and impacts, not just about philanthropic efforts. Whilst these can make a contribution, businesses’ own impacts should be the focus. 2) You can get a feel from companies about those that understand the issues and those that don’t. If they are able to show a real understanding of the concerns of those affected by their operations &#8211; even if they don’t necessarily agree about the solutions -that shows they are listening. It is important to acknowledge where there are problems, rather than rushing to deny all issues. 3) A company that is really genuine will be investing in the bigger picture beyond their own operations. We know these issues are complicated and often not under one company’s direct control. It’s down their supply chains where it is not easy to drive change quickly, but you can differentiate between the companies that are investing to change the broader system compared to those who are just trying to prove that their own operations aren’t causing a problem. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do, where should they start? JT: It can be very challenging. I speak to a lot of graduates who want to work for an organisation like Oxfam and are just starting out. I think having real world experience can be very valuable. This could be very different, anything from having 3 years corporate work experience to experience living and working in a developing country. Oxfam sometimes offer internship positions for those starting out. BFP: Finally; what do you hope to get out of being part of the BFP community? JT: 1) Innovative ideas. Sometimes in your daily work, you’re surrounded by wonderful people, but any organisation can get wrapped up in its own mind set, so it is great to get fresh ideas from different perspectives and 2) meeting people who are working on similar challenges – shared pain sometimes!

20777,Fernando Casado,https://businessfightspoverty.org/fernando-casado,"BFP: What do you do? FC: I am the Founder and Director of the Centre for Partnerships for Development a strategic consulting firm based in Barcelona with representation in Washington DC and Tunisia, promoting development projects through multi-stakeholder governance systems. In our projects we promote private sector engagement with international organizations, public institutions and civil society organizations with the aim of maximizing impact on development goals. Core areas of work are climate change and energy efficiency, green economy, SME and inclusive business promotion, aid efficiency &amp; evaluation and transition towards sustainable development. BFP: What is the best part about your job? FC: Although it might sound cliché, the most gratifying part of my job is generating impact. When we talk to CSR corporate managers or business innovators that don’t have a clear idea on how to use their budgets solving development challenges; when we engage them with fund managers of international organizations that don’t have the expertise generating economic activities; and incorporate public institutions or civil society organizations that provide policy design and expertise with local communities but frequently lack access to core funding, something special happens. We know each one of them can’t provide transformational and sustainable solutions on their own, so helping them work together and seeing how jointly they can achieve impact empowering and transforming people’s lives, it’s really what makes our day. BFP: What have been your greatest challenges? FC: By far, it has been working on post-conflict economies trying to develop economic local empowerment. When working with local entrepreneurs and SMEs in such economies, we not only deal with harder challenges due to lack of resources, damaged infrastructure, weakened public institutions and lack of enabling environments in general, but also with individuals that frequently have suffered post-traumatic consequences of war and are rarely given the proper support they need to overcome it. BFP: How have you overcome these challenges?/ What advice, would you give to others? FC: Most importantly, we make sure we engage the right experts and partners in the process. We have actually developed a Partnership Strategic Management Tool to perform very detailed stakeholder mapping processes that allow us to identify and select the most appropriate partners based on their economic potential contribution, their knowledge generation capacity and their expertise of the development challenges being faced. Under these challenges, working with the best qualified candidates and most prepared partners is an essential key to success. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do, where should they start? FC: I have seen a lot of people interested in the development sector but I think at the end it requires a certain vocational interest. You need a lot of flexibility and adaptation capacity, as one day you can be working with corporate CEOs and engaging political deputies committing funds, and the other you are working with indigenous community leaders and implementing projects with low-income communities of rural areas. So I think that most importantly is that you truly believe in what you are doing, that you believe in your capacity of contributing to contribute to the transition towards a more inclusive and sustainable society and that you live each day fully committed with passion. BFP: Finally, what do you hope to get out of being part of the BFP community? FC: We work for several international organizations on projects that always engage private sector helping achieve better development results. So we are excited about participating in a platform of practitioners that have so much experience and interest on helping increase business role fighting poverty. We look forward to interact with them and hopefully to be able to work jointly in providing more sustainable solutions that respond to global challenges.

20780,Jimmy Bettcher,https://businessfightspoverty.org/jimmy-bettcher,"BFP: What do you do? JB: I am Strategic Analyst and Project Manager, Corporate Responsibility at Cummins Inc. Cummins is a global power leader, that designs, manufactures, distributes and services engines and related technologies, including fuel systems, controls, air handling, filtration, emission solutions and electrical power generation systems. I manage strategic social impact projects for Cummins in Africa and other emerging markets. The bulk of my work revolves around building partnerships with other businesses and organizations to maximize the impact of Cummins’ initiatives on the ground. BFP: What is the best part about your job? JB: There are two things that I really enjoy about my job. The first is aligning opportunities for social impact with strategic business interests of the company. The second is working with talented people from all over the world to unleash to power of business to address major social problems. BFP: What have been your greatest challenges? JB: Building a strong business case for social impact projects in a down economy has been the biggest challenge I continue to face. BFP: How have you overcome these challenges? What advice, would you give to others? JB: An entrepreneurial mindset and an understanding of the important role of humility are very important in my work. Viewing socio-economic and environmental problems as opportunities for innovation and gaining business insights has helped in pitching CR projects to business leaders. Humility is also incredibly important when dealing with issues of global poverty. I would encourage anyone spending time on the ground in the developing world to view every interaction as an opportunity to learn, be it from talking to a CEO or a woman selling bananas on the side of the street. This will help to fight the natural tendency to impose our own beliefs and solutions on local problems. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do, where should they start? JB: Seek out opportunities to gain tangible skills and experience. Business school is an excellent way to build valuable skills and a mindset focused on innovation and efficiency that is applicable to many fields. There is no substitute for on-the-ground experience in emerging markets, even if for brief periods of time. BFP: Finally, what do you hope to get out of being part of the BFP community? JB: I hope to connect with a global community of like-minded individuals. I am especially interested in networking to build partnerships involving Cummins strategic initiatives in technical/vocational education and rural electrification around the world.

20783,Edward Hanrahan,https://businessfightspoverty.org/edward-hanrahan,"BFP: What do you do? EH: I am a director at ClimateCare. Started in 1997 ClimateCare was originally set up to help large corporates take responsibility for their unavoidable carbon emissions. Of course, since then the world has moved on. Businesses are now well aware of their carbon and other impacts and whilst we still help organisations offset their carbon emissions, our focus is now on developing integrated environment and CSR programmes that make both positive environmental and social impacts, for example improving access to safe water, cutting carbon emissions and improving health, in a measurable way. ‘Carbon for Water’ is a project that distributed 877,000 water filters in Western Kenya in April 2011. It displaced the boiling of water on open fires, generating 2.7 million tons of emission reductions every year. As a result 877,000 households, almost 4.5 million people, now have sustainable access to safe water. ClimateCare contributed to the ‘Carbon for Water’project by structuring the finance and writing the original methodology. This allowed the calculation of carbon emissions savings. All of our projects must do three things, 1) reduce emissions, 2) have a positive impact on poverty or health, and 3) have a profitable outcome. The reason we look for a profitable outcome is that our overall objective is to leverage capital markets into funding climate and development challenges. We look for ways of bringing new, additional private sector investment into things that have traditionally been development projects. BFP: What is the best part about your job? EH:There are many great parts to my job &#8211; working with an inspired and motivated team and partners, having the freedom to innovate and take a few risks and being constantly and pleasantly surprised at just how much one small team can actually achieve. But as I live my privileged developed world life, if I had to single out one thing &#8211; above all others &#8211; it is when I make it out to a project that we have been involved in and I meet someone &#8211; a person, not a number, or a statistic &#8211; an inspirational person who is doing so much with so little and whose life has been changed, affected, improved in some small way &#8211; that is when I know we, and others like us, are really making a difference. BFP: What have been your greatest challenges? EH: As many of us at ClimateCare come from a scientific and engineering background, rigorous measurement is important to us, and the reason we were able to develop methodologies accepted by the Gold Standard and Clean Development Mechanism (measurement bodies). Our robust view of measurement was strengthened further we were acquired by JP Morgan in 2008 (we bought ClimateCare back again in 2011). One of the key things we learnt whilst there was a very stringent approach to financial measurement and managing risk. This knowledge and expertise has stood us in good stead, however, the real challenge now is to apply this depth of knowledge to help us devise ways to measure development outcomes and impacts. We can’t measure all development outcomes, but those that we can, we absolutely should. It’s important not to let the difficulty put us off measuring at all. Another challenge for our sector is to spend less time being intra-critical and more time moving forward together. If we all put as much energy into moving forward as reviewing each other’s methods, we would achieve a lot more. That isn’t to say that peer review and constructive criticism is not necessary- it absolutely is. BFP: How have you overcome these challenges?/ What is the secret of your success? EH: We used to come up against scepticism about offsetting. We looked at the situation from a purely pragmatic, scientific point of view &#8211; we want to reduce emissions and limit global warming. The way we talk to customers is to always go back to the facts. Now what we’re trying to do is to make it more profitable to fund action to tackle the critical issues the world faces today including global poverty, environmental degradation and climate change. Ultimately, our aim is to make it more profitable to fund positive action than to fund high carbon or non-positive actions. The day this happens, will be the day we can leverage a large part of the capital markets and the day that a large proportion of the world’s problems start to be solved. If it becomes more profitable to tackle climate change than to cause climate change we will be in a very different position to that we are in today. Much of the resistance we face to our approach today is philosophical resistance about the motives of the corporates and the capital markets. However, I would say that their motives are very clear &#8211; they want to make a return on their investment. If they can do that, and have a positive impact at the same time, then that is fantastic, for them and for the world as a whole. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do, where should they start? EH: The way to start, as in all of these things, is to pick up the phone to organisations that are working in this area and say you’d like to come and work with them. Or if they are already within the ‘business fighting poverty’ arena &#8211; they should see if they can get something running in the environment they are already working in. Maybe you can reach out and collaborate with another organisation- like ClimateCare or DFID, for example. This will of course be a big challenge. However, when we look for people, it is for those that understand that this area is challenging, but are committed to the hard work of innovation. Be prepared to take a step backwards into the world you want to work in. My own experience is that I was quite a senior director in the internet space and some time ago I decided I wanted to do something much more positive. I had key transferable skills &#8211; I understood finance and I understood management. I looked around for an organisation that had a gap, where my skills would be useful, and that’s how I came to ClimateCare. I had to take quite a step back career wise and actually had to move my family across the other side of the world from Australia back to the UK. Whilst it may seem difficult at the time, it only tends to be for a couple of years and it’s worth it if you want to do something you’re very passionate about. BFP: Finally; what do you hope to get out of being part of the BFP community? EH: We see things on Business Fights Poverty at least once a week that are emailed around to everybody in our organisation. There are two reasons for that; the first, that we see an opportunity and the second, inspiration &#8211; it’s a good reminder that others are out there doing fantastic things. We see a lot of innovation on Business Fights Poverty &#8211; we see a lot of very passionate, focused people doing positive things, even at times like these, with the economic crisis, when it is hard to get resource and finance applied to these types of projects. I think Business Fights Poverty is great; it gives us inspiration- both practical inspiration, that we can apply, and also general feel good inspiration.

20787,Richard Brophy,https://businessfightspoverty.org/richard-brophy,"BFP: What do you do? RB: I’m Head of Corporate Responsibility for Herbert Smith Freehills. I manage our relationships with a wide range of NGOs, think tanks, schools, and academic institutions both in a domestic and international setting. This ranges from a school five minutes walk from our London office to international NGOs and developing country governments. The focus of our work is quite broad – we cover everything from access to opportunity and social mobility to more macro issues like human rights, climate change, sustainable development and the rule of law. I am also a trustee for a law and development charity called Advocates for International Development. A4ID was set up to engage the legal community in development issues and connect them with NGOs and governments to help achieve the Millennium Development Goals. It’s about recognising that law is a critical tool in achieving development aims. In addition to this, I am Director of the Corporate Responsibility Group, which is the professional body for leading corporate responsibility and sustainability professionals in the UK. We provide training and development opportunities for people who are trying to help their business address some of these issues. BFP: What is the best part about your job? RB:I am really privileged to work with some fantastically intelligent and thoughtful people, both within Herbert Smith Freehills itself and amongst those we work with outside. I am lucky also to have a great team, with very different but complementary personalities and skill sets. Although we are a small team we are fortunate to be able to call upon people from within the firm at all levels of seniority and cross discipline that are as passionate about the potential for corporate responsibility as we are. Finally, for someone who is a bit obsessed about understanding the challenges facing our world, it&#8217;s hugely rewarding to be able to make a small contribution to making it just a bit better. BFP: What have been your greatest challenges? RB: On a personal level, this year I completed a master’s degree in International Economic Law and Justice and Development. The degree was about trying to understand the role of institutions like the WTO, the IMF, and the World Bank in a development context and in particular their impact on people, their relationships with civil society and corporations etc. It was a challenge because it is a broad and complex subject – combining law with philosophy, international relations theory and economics – and I did it part time. Also, I’m not a lawyer by background so doing a law post-graduate degree as well as managing a heavy workload and having a pre-schooler at home created quite a challenge! Although it was difficult at times, it was important that I did it. I wanted to invest real effort into getting my head round some of these issues. I think it&#8217;s vital we understand how our world is governed and where we are failing. All of the issues we are facing, from pandemics to climate change, non-proliferation to the fulfilment of human rights can be looked at through this lens. In terms of my work here at the firm, one challenge that stands out was a project where we provide a free legal facility for the government of Sierra Leone. It was challenging not because of the mechanics of providing such a facility necessarily, but because it had to go through a number of different hoops to get started. It took us a year and many meetings, presentations and papers to get it off the ground and I’m pleased and delighted we did it. I believe it has been successful and hopefully will continue to be useful, but at times we thought it was never going to happen. We stuck with it as we felt it was a very good touchstone for what we want to do with our approach to corporate responsibility more generally. We think there is a real opportunity within a law firm context to use corporate responsibility as a tool to contribute to society, but also to provide context for the work we are doing with our clients and help us to better navigate the markets in which we are operating. BFP: How have you overcome these challenges?/ What is the secret of your success? RB: I don&#8217;t know if I feel particularly successful, but I am still here and so in my view, I think resilience is pretty critical. I have been doing this kind of work now for 9-10 years and I have seen it change enormously in this time, particularly in the last few years. We’re seeing more corporations recognising that sustainability is a critical part of their business. That understanding that corporate responsibility is not only about addressing potential reputational risk, it’s actually about identifying opportunities, working with governments and NGOs to address social and environmental challenges, and doing so in a way that is good for business in a commercially viable way. Even in our case we have seen potential for new service lines and new ways we can support our clients in a way that also reflects the work we’re doing in CR and sustainability. For example, the work of Professor John Ruggie on business and human rights, as well as new developments around social entrepreneurship, impact investing- those areas where the social and the commercial collide in a productive way- have all been important drivers. This methodology is maturing and that is quite exciting, seeing that change keeps you going. On a day-to-day basis you may still be doing largely what you were doing a couple of years ago, but you can see subtle changes in recognition internally that there is more to this than some nice pictures on the website or a feel good factor. It is actually about how we support our business and help it to grow, how we develop our own people and how we support our clients. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do, where should they start? RB: I generally advise people to survey the whole landscape; it’s not just limited to the big names from the FTSE100. There is a much broader landscape out there. If you want to help business fight poverty, you don’t necessarily need to do it from within a blue chip corporation. You may do it working for an organisation like BFP, a think tank, an NGO or an investment fund etc. People often just think of those we see on the high street, but there is a much larger group of players out there. Getting experience of business is going to be useful, even if your first, second or third job is not in corporate responsibility. Its important to be commercially aware, and you can get that in most jobs within a business. Grow your understanding on the issues; spend time attending lectures, seminars, events. There is lots of that on offer, particularly in the bigger cities around the world. In addition to BFP, in London we have great organisations like The RSA and Chatham House – both of which publish a lot of material online, and you have the TED facility of course, Intelligence Squared, etc. Be humble about your level of understanding and accept it’s a messy world we live in. It will take time to get a handle on it and find the way that your skills can help to untangle the mess. Build and use your network&#8211; going to these events will also help you meet people, and network. It will help you get an idea of what’s worrying them and how you can help. As well as being in a better position to hear about opportunities. BFP: Finally; what do you hope to get out of being part of the BFP community? RB: What I get out of BFP already is that I think it is a fantastic resource, when I get the emails or the LinkedIn updates there is always something in there that I might have missed elsewhere and that for me is vital. Around these issues there is huge amount of material being published, which can be daunting, and it’s useful to have a place where it is aggregated. I’m not sure I’ve used it as effectively as I could as a network resource, I have attended the events but I could do more to participate in discussions and meet people virtually.

20790,Maria Sanchez-Marin Melero,https://businessfightspoverty.org/maria-sanchez-marin-melero,"BFP: What do you do? MSM: I head the TrustLaw Connect service at the Thomson Reuters Foundation, where we link the best NGOs and social enterprises in need of free legal assistance around the world with the best law firms. Our mission is to expand the practise of pro bono around the world, which means often creating both the demand and the supply of pro bono assistance. Outside of countries like the US, UK, Australia or South Africa, there has been little pro bono done in a structured manner, particularly when it is helping organisations rather than individuals. Many of the NGOs or social enterprises we work with would not have thought of approaching a lawyer for advice before we get in touch. Sometimes it is an expense that they cannot afford, other times theydon’t even realise a lawyer can help – which means that these organisations end up finding themselves in difficult situations which may challenge their whole existence. For example, theintellectual property they rely on may not beprotected, or they might sign funding contracts that are counterproductive for their programmes, or their staff or volunteers (who often operate in difficult environments) not protected. We also work with organisations which want to advance policy in all sorts of field, from women’s rights to land rights or transparency. Our law firms help them to understand the existing laws, learn about the best practises across different jurisdictions, and start thinking about where the sector might go in the future. BFP: What is the best part about your job? MSM:People! I am surrounded by passionate and very professional colleagues; by exceptional NGO staff and social entrepreneurs selflessly working really hard – and sometimes in very difficult circumstances &#8211; just because they think the world can be a better and more equitable place; by lawyers from Ethiopia to Sydney who again and again recognise this and contribute in the best way they can, with their much needed legal expertise. BFP: What have been your greatest challenges? MSM: Many, which has made this project so exciting and rewarding. What we are doing at TrustLaw Connect is unique. At the end of the day we are saying to NGOs or social enterprises anywhere around the world “come to us and we will find one of the best lawyers in your country to work for you, for free”. As I mentioned before, pro bono is not a traditional practise in most countries around the world, so you have to work on building the market in any country in the world, with a limited amount of resources. You need to make sure that there is a core model that works throughout, but you also must understand the local practises in different countries and regions. So you have to talk to many people, listen a lot, and continually adapt what you’re doing. BFP: How have you overcome these challenges?/ What is the secret of your success MSM: We’ve overcome barriers with hard work and more hard work; talking to our member NGOs, social enterprises, law firms, corporations and listening to what they are telling us; adapting our model accordingly until we have found the right way of doing things; believing in what we are doing and believing in the organisations and companies with whom we work. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do, where should they start? MSM: They should get in touch with us! Join us, follow our news, come to our events… Using the service is the best thing they can do! BFP: Finally; what do you hope to get out of being part of the BFP community? MSM: Learn from what others are doing in the same sort of field. After many years in an NGO, I did an MBA at the Said Business School (Oxford University) because, among other things, I wanted to find like minded people who believed in the power of the private sector to do good. You are IT! Editor&#8217;s Note: Thank you to Maria Sanchez-Marin Melero for taking the time to do this interview. We&#8217;re always looking out for members to feature.

20793,Tim Bishop,https://businessfightspoverty.org/tim-bishop,"BFP: What do you do? TB: Based in Vietnam, but operating across the Asia Pacific region, I work for CARE International and am developing new programming and partnership opportunities between CARE and the private sector, which address poverty and social injustice. This has come from the premise that CARE believes the private sector plays a critical role as an enabler of sustainable economic growth and development. We engage with multi-national corporations, SMEs and others to ensure fair, transparent interactions that take into consideration the unique assets and needs of those marginalized and vulnerable populations we seek to serve. BFP: What is the best part about your job? TB: The diversity of the day-to-day. I work with CARE colleagues in a variety of countries in this region, through which we are assessing collaboration opportunities with several different industries – such as retail, finance and pharmaceutical. I also get the chance to profile our experiences and learnings at events and forums, and examine how we might best leverage these and scale up this work. BFP: What have been your greatest challenges? TB: In this particular nexus of business, NGOs, civil society and public sector working closer together, it can take time to find those partnerships and tangible ideas that genuinely have the potential to make a difference over the longer term. A lot is talked about “impact” and how to best measure this, and currently, as a wider community, we are all still struggling with what best practice tools might look like to do this. We’d benefit from such tools, and also from more pragmatic approaches taken by organisations to how cross-sector collaborations of these kinds are ultimately brokered, managed and implemented. BFP: How have you overcome these challenges?/ What is the secret of your success? TB: Focusing in on what it is your organisation brings to these types of multi-stakeholder discussions. Knowing your boundaries and your limitations as a partner, and sometimes having to cede control of certain things, and appreciate that you cannot always deliver the results to which you aspire, but that you can still learn from these experiences. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do, where should they start? TB: Many of the same skill sets required to engage on issues of sustainability and community engagement are found across different sectors and roles – whether this is for a corporate CSR manager, or for an NGO partnerships manager. Having a diverse set of sectoral experiences is becoming more recognised as a positive for employers of these types of roles. Finally, the CSR eco-system is a small one, often relying on a networked approach to how respective companies and NGOs recruit and source their talent. BFP: Finally, what do you hope to get out of being part of the BFP community? TB: Connectivity, new ideas, and a chance to learn from the experiences of others – whether through achievements or challenges. I think BFP has grown very rapidly into a hugely useful and resourceful network, and long may it continue! Editor&#8217;s Note: Thank you to Tim Bishop for taking the time to do this interview.

20797,Sophia Hyder,https://businessfightspoverty.org/sophia-hyder,"BFP: What do you do? SH: Evolvemint’s innovative business model merges fashion with sustainable economic development approaches without compromising quality and classic style. Scarves, and accessories are crafted from silk that is ethically sourced from suppliers in Bangladesh, as well as recycled saris. (We are also currently working on a clothing collection using these fabrics). To promote our mission, I am involved with all the fundamental actions needed to make Evolvemint a success. Operationally, I work on product and market development. Technically, I work to make sure all parts of the supply chain from producers to consumers recognize that gender issues exist, and can be improved throughout each part of the process. BFP: What is the best part about your job? SH: I have the biggest smile on my face when I talk to people about how Evolvemint empowers women and inspires fresh change. I believe the sky is the limit, and anything is possible. So the best part of my job is that I am able harness my creativity into solutions that positively impact the lives of women in a sustainable manner. Here’s an example of how I have been closing the information gap between supplier and consumer. In Bangladesh I work together with partners to inform them about what colors are in style each season so they are able to understand consumer demand along with quality assurance expectations. I work with them to build and improve upon their business capacities. In the United States, I inform my clients about the origination of Evolvemint’s products and the impact they bring to society by purchasing from our collection. BFP: What have been your greatest challenges? SH: Strong partnerships have been the key to realizing my goal of starting a business that supports and promotes truly sustainable economic development practices. Building those relationships abroad was extremely challenging. As Evolvemint came into being, I worked diligently to navigate through roadblocks related to perceptions, stigmas, and cultural differences, before I found the people who would share my vision. When I visited potential vendors and partners in target countries, I was seldom welcomed to share my ideas about collaborating because I happened to be female. Not only was I looked down upon, but was often criticized for trying to “change a norm”. I was quite honestly shocked at the reactions I received from people with whom I thought I shared a common bond, a common history. I did not anticipate these barriers, and I became emotional at times because I was being so transparent and honest about how I saw these partnerships benefitting all parties in the long run. BFP: How have you overcome these challenges? / / What is the secret of your success? SH: I learned to lean on trusted colleagues who understood, and shared, my motivations and passions, and through them, I was able to sift through myriad non-starters to find partnerships that would really work. After establishing our own &#8216;norms&#8217;, the Evolvemint team was able to move forward through a planning process for the successful implementation of a shared vision working towards gender empowerment and sustainable economic development practices. My advice to others is to believe in yourself and your ideas and never give up. You will have disappointments, and make mistakes, but you can only learn and grow from these occurrences. Evolvemint’s business model continues to improve because of our lessons learned and our persistent belief that we can exercise creativity through fashion to enhance the livelihoods of women in Bangladesh. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do, where should they start? SH: My epiphany happened in 2010 after I realized that I had reached a plateau in my professional life. I yearned to find happiness through meaningful work, and knew that combining my two favorite passions, international development and fashion, would let me do just that. I brainstormed ideas that would make me truly excited to get up and work every day, and Evolvemint is that dream come to fruition. I wanted to create classic, elegant designs for dresses and skirts using use bold prints and high quality fabrics – in a nutshell, my aspiration was to create the clothing and accessories that I would wear myself, but couldn’t find in stores. I also wanted to be able to trace the origin of my apparel, to appreciate clothing as a work of art and confidence. As an international development professional, it was imperative for me to create a business model that is economically sustainable, supports micro/small/medium enterprises and promotes gender equality. One of the most important elements of my work is that it connects me to my Bengali and Indian roots, and though I was born in Indiana, these countries are home to people who share my cultural heritage. I realize how fortunate I have been throughout my life, and my deepest desire is to provide opportunities for people who want to build a life that makes them feel valued and happy. If you want to start a socially responsible business, brainstorm all your ideas about what your motivations are and what you plan to accomplish through your business. Organize these thoughts and share them with your trusted peers. Develop your vision and mission and then ask yourself what steps you will take to achieve these goals. Be aware that your business plan will continuously change, but you have to make sure you have established the fundamental building blocks of your vision and mission. Also make sure you understand the environment you will be operating in – nothing can be solved unless you are intimately familiar with the enabling environment you plan to work within. BFP: Finally; what do you hope to get out of being part of the BFP community? SH: I joined this community because I wanted to converse with like-minded people who share my beliefs towards creating sustainable development alternatives through business. This community has much to offer, and I believe if we share our ideas and collaborate, we can be more effective in creating meaningful change. I would be happy to exchange ideas to further our collective goals towards fighting poverty. I believe we have the spirit, intentions, and expertise.

20800,Taryn Bird,https://businessfightspoverty.org/taryn-bird,"BFP: What do you do? TB:I manage several issues related to corporate citizenship and CSR for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce’s Business Civic Leadership Center, most of them focused on emerging-market social and economic development. My job entails working with U.S.-based multinationals such as Dow Chemical, Abbott, Chevron, and Microsoft on their social and philanthropic investments outside of the United States. Members of our business network are investing in building capacity in the communities where they currently operate or are looking to operate in the future. This can take the shape of addressing food security, technology gaps, gender equality, financial inclusions programs, and more. BCLC helps our business network gain insights about best practice models on a global and local level and shares the story of their corporate citizenship portfolios. We also provide our network with great connections to their peers and stakeholders so they can achieve even more impact. BFP: What is the best part about your job? TB: The best part of my job is spending time in the field. I am fortunate to travel with many of the members in our business network to see their programs and facilities outside the United States. I continue to be amazed at how the business sector has innovated, changed, and grown in its ability to solve social challenges with their unique resources such as corporate dollars, product, and people. Meeting the corporate staff in the field changed the way I looked at CSR and local talent acquisition. I find that every corporate employee I meet – whether from Haiti, Brazil, or South Africa – truly believes in the power of their company to increase opportunity and provide social value in their communities. These individuals are some of the most creative people you will meet, as they continue to localize global programs with in-country realities and cultural norms. BFP: What have been your greatest challenges? TB: My greatest challenge at BCLC has been what I consider to be the greatest success in my portfolio: the formation of Business Corps. BCLC, in partnership with Executives Without Borders (EwB), developed a corporate-led, skills-based volunteerism pilot program in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil over the past year. It was an ambitious goal and one that required substantial partnership development on many levels. Eight companies joined with BCLC to create Business Corps: Dow Chemical, Amadeus, HP, IBM, Alcoa, Tupperware, Merck, and Motorola Foundation. Their shared goal is to leverage their internal human talent to build the capacity of community development organizations in Rio. Together, we made the strategic decision to focus the Business Corps’ community engagements on the areas of: access to education, entrepreneurism and small business, vocational training, and improved conditions for employment opportunities. EwB is the on-the-ground partner and serves as the liaison with the volunteers and non-profit organizations to make sure the right business skill sets are matched with the needs. The volunteer opportunities leverage employee or company core competencies and create collective impact in a key growth market for business. Business Corps will continue to innovate and grow over the next few years. We are proud of what we have done in the first year of the pilot and where we are going in the future. BFP: How have you overcome these challenges?/ What is the secret of your success? TB: Partnership development is all about setting clear expectations and goals. The important components of our cross-company and cross-sector approach have been being open with each other on what we can and cannot deliver, who we are and who we are not, and serving those we can and saying no when we know other organizations could serve them better. Setting clear expectations and investing time in understanding the realities of your partners is critical to partnership success, while also creating impact that would be unattainable on your own. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do, where should they start? TB: If someone is looking to get into CSR, I would suggest they do three things: Immediately get field experience working for a social enterprise or non-profit in a sector that you feel passionate about. Nothing can prepare you more for a job in CSR than getting in the field and spending time understanding how programs work on a day-to-day basis. Develop a strong understanding of a desired company’s business units and investigate their priorities and goals. One of the biggest challenges in CSR is internal; showcasing how CSR investments bring value to a company. By understanding the priorities of business units you will be able to align the company’s social investments with brand, communications, and economic goals. This is extremely important in emerging markets, where social investments can have huge economic and brand benefits for the company and the community where they are operating. Get networked &#8212; and get to the BCLC Global Conference on October 10 -12 in Washington, DC. BFP: Finally; what do you hope to get out of being part of the BFP community? TB: I hope to gain insights to learn how other types of companies are working to solve challenges in emerging markets. Multinational companies are only one piece to the puzzle and social enterprise and SMEs are also playing a large role. I am also looking forward to participating in the Africa Hub. I just returned from a six-month sabbatical in Rwanda working for the fashion social enterprise, Indego Africa. It was an incredible experience and I am looking forward to learning more about organizations like Indego, who are creating opportunity in Africa through responsible business practices.

BYR: I am a Partner, Head Of Impact at D8A/ Appfrica.D8A work to help the world&#8217;s leading companies discover business opportunities in Africa while helping African technologists serve a global market. My position as Partner at D8A means wearing many hats; I’m primarily focused on business development and sales for D8A’s technical products, and partnership and program development for D8A’s impact work in Africa through our Appfrica and Apps4Africa initiatives. BFP: What is the best part about your job? BYR: Being able to travel the world, connecting with potential clients, African organizations and entrepreneurs that will be tomorrow’s business leaders. Our network is wide and broad, and it’s a honor to know that in 10-15 years, we will be considered one of the first organizations to support technology entrepreneurs on the continent. BFP: What have been your greatest challenges? BYR: Positioning our brand recognition to leverage all the value propositions that we offer. Because we’re a social enterprise, we believe in walking the walk as a business, so it’s not just about charity or helping others succeed- it’s about being successful as a technology company AND serving as an example and support for other technologists that want to do the same. BFP: How have you overcome these challenges? / What advice, would you give to others? BYR: Clarity in communications and branding is key to attracting the right customers. We’ve spent a lot of time refining our communications to reflect our expertise and product offerings. I think the secret of my success is my passion for entrepreneurship, both within our company and through supporting other entrepreneurs. I’m continually problem solving; this keeps me highly engaged and constantly learning. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do, where should they start? BYR: An undergraduate or graduate degree in international relations or international business is a great start, but beyond formal education, it’s important to spend time cultivating relationships with people that you respect,t who are doing things similar to what you would like to do. Relationships tend to give you back what you put into them, so quality time, empathy and knowledge sharing is important to stay abreast of what trends are emerging in your given field. BFP: Finally, what do you hope to get out of being part of the BFP community? BYR: Business Fights Poverty is a supporter of the U.S. State Department’s Lions@frica initiative, of which we were founding partners.

20806,Anisha Rajapakse,https://businessfightspoverty.org/anisha-rajapakse,"BFP: What do you do? AR: Reporting to the Board of Trustees in the UK, I have overall responsibility for strengthening the remit and strategic directions of child-focused projects and programmes of our Ugandan NGO, Ka Tutandike Uganda. This includes capacity building, mentoring and support to the Ugandan team in areas such as effective programme conceptualization and management, resource mobilization, and communications; as well as strategies towards influencing policy to protect the rights of the vulnerable child. All interventions are aimed at enabling tangible and sustaining improvements in the health and well being of children living in conditions of extreme poverty in and around urban markets. We also provide knowledge and skills to the parents to become self reliant and generate new income to raise their quality of life and create a better future for their children. BFP: What is the best part about your job? AR: The best part of my job is being out in the field in Uganda– spending quality time with the communities (especially the children) and doing more listening than talking. It’s really important to have honest and open dialogue with the people and understand about their aspirations and hopes for a better life. Building mutual trust and respect is critical. I feel privileged to be in a position to genuinely help make a difference and empower poor communities. My work keeps me inspired and grounded in reality. BFP: What have been your greatest challenges? AR: The major challenges I’ve encountered over the last few years have centred around trying to reduce/end poverty and inequalities in a world where severe budgetary restrictions and donor fatigue has rapidly set in, and the poorest people and the poorest countries now receive much less support. Business as usual in grant giving/making is clearly not possible. Furthermore, an unhealthy culture of donor dependency has set in over the years, and that makes it quite an uphill task to change the mindset of partners and stakeholders in resource-poor settings to take the reins themselves to ditch the hand-out culture and to take charge of their futures with a real desire to break free from a vicious cycle of poverty themselves by their own solutions. BFP: How have you overcome these challenges?/ What is the secret of your success? AR: Such challenges can actually overcomed by working to change the mindset of vulnerable communities through providing knowledge and skills to enable them to initiate social enterprise initiatives so that they actually make their own decisions and implement their own development priorities. I meet some amazing, dynamic and entrepreneurial people at the grassroots in Uganda– especially women who have the drive, energy and leadership qualities to take charge of their lives and of their families. Working with such individuals, it is possible to change the tide towards self reliance &#8211; because I’ve seen that what keeps poor people from realizing their full potential is lack of choice and opportunity. My advice to others is not to get too mired in all the development jargon and theory. Simply to listen to the voices from the ground and work in partnership with the people you are trying to help. Build trust and have empathy. It is important to understand that even just one successful social entrepreneurship initiative in a poor community in a developing country will change that community forever – and the lives of hundreds of other people. I wouldn’t really say that there is a secret to my success. I’ve been in the field of international development for almost 20 years and from the early days in school, I always wanted to do what I am doing today as a career. I get immense personal satisfaction helping and empowering vulnerable people implementing measures and strategies towards protecting their rights. It’s a continuing passion. Without heart and passion it is almost impossible to make any real and positive difference in this area of work. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do, where should they start? AR: If someone wants to get into international development, the starting point is to gain experience at the field level. Degrees and doctorates alone do not provide a hands-on insight into ground realities. You need to get your feet wet and your hands dirty. BFP: Finally; what do you hope to get out of being part of the BFP community? AR: It is a valuable platform that brings together philanthropy/charity and the business sector with the common objective to end poverty. Working in the not-for-profit sector, and promoting the importance of aligning charities to a social enterprise model, I learn from other members about best practices and challenges that in turn help me shape even better targeted interventions and strategies.

20809,Charles Arthur,https://businessfightspoverty.org/charles-arthur,"BFP: What do you do? CA: UNIDO is the specialized agency of the United Nations that promotes industrial development for poverty reduction, inclusive globalization and environmental sustainability. The main part of my job is producing the organization’s two flagship publications: the quarterly discussion magazine, Making It, and the newsletter, UNIDO Times. I also run the Making It website, and edit promotional material put out by UNIDO’s small Advocacy and Communications Group. BFP: What is the best part about your job? CA: At UNIDO, I am involved with nearly all the pressing issues of the day. Climate change, the transition to a low-carbon economy, how to recover from the economic crisis, green growth and green industry, renewable energy, cleaner production, resource and energy efficiency, poverty reduction, CSR, youth entrepreneurship….you name it! UNIDO is so very relevant and so very important, especially given the state of the world today. UNIDO’s three mandates: poverty reduction through productive activities, trade capacity building, and energy and the environment, cover so many of the issues confronting, not just developing countries, but the whole world. It’s fantastic being part of the team highlighting all the great things that UNIDO is doing. For me, some of the exciting, tangible aspects of UNIDO’s work are: • the Montreal Protocol, where over 100 countries have benefited from UNIDO&#8217;s support in phasing out ozone-depleting substances; • the 50 national cleaner production and international technology centres established to support industries in their transition towards more sustainable patterns of production; • the Sustainable Energy for All initiative, spearheaded by the UNIDO Director-General, which promotes energy that is accessible, cleaner and more efficient; • the Green Industry Platform, which provides a framework for bringing together governmental, business and civil society leaders to mobilize action in support of greening the manufacturing process and creating green industries for production of goods and services for domestic use or export. BFP: What have been your greatest challenges? CA: UNIDO doesn’t have a high public profile, and even if people do know about it, then they don’t usually know what it does. I think the words ‘industrial development’ evoke images of factories and smokestacks, and this gives a false impression of the organization. While some of UNIDO’s work does focus on large-scale industrial plants, on manufacturing factories, a huge part of it is focused on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Rather than industry, a more accurate description of UNIDO’s area of work would be productive activities. Just looking at recent examples of UNIDO projects in different regions of the world gives a fuller, rounder picture: in rural Sierra Leone, UNIDO is establishing mini-hydro-electric power stations to provide energy to improve irrigation and sanitation and to boost SMEs; in Lebanon, UNIDO helped found the Lebanese Packing Centre (LibanPack) to ensure conformity with international packing standards, safeguard consumer health and protect the environment; in Viet Nam, UNIDO is helping to develop a green branding concept for the country’s handicraft sector; and in Bolivia, UNIDO is implementing a programme to create economic activities for women living in extreme poverty. BFP: How have you overcome these challenges? / What advice, would you give to others? / What is the secret of your success? CA: One of the aims of UNIDO’s Making It magazine, of which I am the editor, is to show the breadth and scope of the issues that UNIDO is engaged with. It is not a magazine about UNIDO but about the issues. The current issue is about youth employment and entrepreneurship, the one before about health and industry, and before that about the low-carbon economy. Contributors come from a wide range of backgrounds, including government representatives, the private sector, and civil society. The magazine is now nearly three years old and the readership is growing rapidly. I am working to make use of social media, such as Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn, and this is proving to be an effective, cheaper and greener method of promoting the existence of the magazine than sending out print copies by post. The online pdf issues are getting between 60,000 to 100,000 reads per issue. I recommend tapping the potential offered by the Internet, especially as a way of raising awareness among young people. BFP:If someone wants to do what you do, where should they start? CA:Before I came to UNIDO, I had a varied career, running my own business and then in journalism and activism, working as a freelance and as an advocacy campaigner focusing on the struggle for participatory democracy in Haiti. I think this has served me well, both in terms of helping me see things from a variety of perspectives and of having a better understanding of the reality of and reasons for poverty in the 21st century. BFP: Finally; what do you hope to get out of being part of the BFP community? CA: Obviously I want the BFP community to get a better idea of what UNIDO does and to read Making It magazine! Specifically, I would like BFPers to know that UNIDO is increasingly working with companies and foundations to build partnerships that advance inclusive and sustainable industrial development, while simultaneously driving business value. UNIDO’s Business Partnership Programme harnesses the expertise, know-how and resources of the private sector to tackle important global industrial development issues. I also value BFP because it gives me the opportunity to read about some of the initiatives being taken by the private sector and civil society, and the partnerships that are being developed to try and develop a sustainable future.

20812,Patrick Anigbo,https://businessfightspoverty.org/patrick-anigbo,"BFP: What do you do? PA: I wear two hats. I started Diro Systems, a young IT Services business with operations in the UK and Nigeria in 2008, which I still run. I am also a member of the organising team at TEDxEuston, a TEDx programme run in London every year that focuses on Africa. BFP: What is the best part about your job? PA:With Diro Systems, I love the freedom I have to be as innovative in designing customer solutions as I like. Even though I was fortunate enough to enjoy a really rewarding and productive career for 11 years working for my previous organisation, there were times I felt restricted. It was not always possible to get the management board to back my ideas. With running my own business, comes the opportunity to get involved in developing solutions specifically for the African market starting with our operations in Lagos. This is one adventure I am really passionate about. This brings me to TEDxEuston. I am passionate about Africa and of course Nigeria and being a part of the wonderful TEDxEuston team that will produce our 4thedition this year on the 1 December 2012 has been a truly remarkable journey. I have been able to work with the most amazing colleagues and made friends that I will have for life. I have always enjoyed volunteering from a very young age and this by far is the best team of volunteers I have ever come across. BFP: What have been your greatest challenges? PA: The biggest challenge I have faced with Diro Systems has been starting up a business right at the beginning of the financial meltdown. Growth has been trickier to navigate and it has meant a constant reassessment of priorities and strategy. But we have grown through these challenges and are really well placed to play a role in the post-recession boom that is sure to come. At TEDxEuston the challenge has always been time but when you are enjoying something the way we all are, we have always found the time including writing up this interview at 3am in the morning!! BFP: How have you overcome these challenges?/ What advice, would you give to others?/ What is the secret of your success PA: The only way to overcome any challenge is hard work, sacrifice and belief in one’s self and one’s own abilities. With Diro Systems, we have simply worked harder for our clients and tried to give better and better value for their money. When your clients know that you are going that extra mile for them, it stands you out as great value all the time. We have also been more and more innovative in our approach and early adopters of cutting edge technology. At TEDxEuston we have mostly challenges around logistics. With four colleagues out of 16 living in India, Belgium, South Africa and Nigeria it has meant making effective use of technology – Google Groups, Mobile Chat Services (Blackberry and WhatsApp), Teleconferences, Video Conferences and of course Social Media. Most years we have 2 or 3 face to face team meetings and 1 of these happens the week of the event!! The only advice I can give anyone is to pursue your passion every day – make sure you are waking up to do work that really fires up your spirit. Because then you will always have the energy to handle the tough times. And keep good friends!! BFP: If someone wants to do what you do, where should they start? PA: START!! Really!! That is all I can say. As the Nike advert says, Just Do It (Already!!). I found that for a few years I dreamed about running my own business but I always put it off for all sorts of reasons that I now know it was just me limiting myself. The best way to get going is to start. There is an amazing amount of resources for start-ups now compared to 10 years ago. Funding options have improved tremendously especially with the Crowd Funding possibilities that now exist. Have a good idea? It is only a good idea if you do something about it. BFP: Finally; what do you hope to get out of being part of the BFP community? PA: I got to know about BFP through my work with TEDxEuston when BFP came in to partner with us. Since then I have joined the community and honestly sometimes I wake up and log in to get inspired by the amazing conversations and stories on the platform. I get fired up by the number of similarly minded business people out there that do not see business as simply a way to improve our own lives but as an opportunity to win the fight against world poverty one square inch at a time. I hope to not only keep getting inspired by others on here but to also do enough from my side to inspire others. As we say at TEDxEuston, we do it together or we don’t do it at all!

20816,Mike Kubzansky,https://businessfightspoverty.org/mike-kubzansky,"BFP: What do you do? MK: I am Partner at Monitor Group, a global management consultancy started 30 years ago by five Harvard Business School professors, including Michael Porter. I lead the inclusive markets practice. Monitor overall advises companies, governments and social sector organisations on issues of growth, in ways that matter to them most. Monitor is also in the business of managing capital &#8212; it has its own group that manages a US private equity fund. But we primarily offer strategy, marketing, innovation and leadership advice to organisations on their key strategic issues. BFP: What is the best part about your job? MK:Two things. First, is really making a difference in terms of poverty outcomes and generally having a social impact; and second, and the challenging part, is being at the leading edge of an area where we are still figuring out what works. BFP: What have been your greatest challenges? MK: We’ve learned after cataloguing over 1,000 inclusive businesses that the biggest challenge in the inclusive business world is the balance of both commercial sustainability and the delivery of real results on the social dimension. That’s what’s new and different. For decades people have been focused on government programmes to address social issues, and separately on firms to earn money. How do you develop a business model that is sufficiently profitable and also delivers real social impact? That’s the big challenge. BFP: How have you overcome these challenges?/ What advice, would you give to others?/ What is the secret of your success MK: One of the recurring themes in all of our publications and the work we’ve done is the importance of getting the right business model to address these markets. In most, if not all cases, you cannot use the same business model to create an inclusive business solution, as you are using in your main middle-class markets in the OCED countries. The time and process of developing and validating a new business model is expensive. You are suddenly engaged in a complex web of much smaller transactions than you are usually making in your mainline sourcing or selling business. And by virtue of the fact that you are trading with or engaging the poor in your supply chains or as consumers means it is not going to be terribly lucrative, the price points just cannot sustain it. Consequently there is usually less margin available to be able to validate and prove out new business models. Our recent publication, From Blueprint to Scale, spells out the need for much more patient and early stage capital to help build out and improve the business models. One general finding from our Africa work is that the business models that have success have a mixed customer base. They don’t exclusively serve the base of the pyramid (BoP), they serve the BoP and usually at least the next segment up. On serving the BoP as consumers, we usually distinguish between market entry and market creation. Our findings show that you can get to scale really quite quickly if you’re doing market entry. For example micro-finance, where a market serving low income segments already exists, even if the existing market is largely informal and often exploitative. The underlying demand is already there. But market creation is different, and it’s expensive. Sometimes, for products for which you’re doing market creation, an enterprise can’t realistically take on the cost of building the market and building the awareness. In this case the adjustment to the model my well be that we need a public sector donor partner to help pay for building the demand and awareness to then make it possible to deliver the product/service in a commercially viable way. For example, in this Monitor report about the business case for financial capability, we outline what a shared agenda would look like for stakeholders in this field, where we argue that donors should absorb the cost of figuring out good financial education pedagogy. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do, where should they start? MK: If you want to be a consultant in our field, you would need three things: 1) Good solid commercial consulting skills, you have to understand the commercial economics of businesses and how to best advise companies; 2) a tactile feel for the commercial and social realties in emerging markets. We need people that have been on the ground and have a sense of the realties of life in emerging markets and the informality and dynamism of local economies. As well as fearlessness about traveling to obscure places. 3) It is helpful to understand how donors think. In my particular case, I worked at Monitor, then left and worked in private industry. Then I then spent half a dozen years working at the World Bank Group before coming back to Monitor. Having that ability to translate between donors and business is very important. BFP: Finally, what do you hope to get out of being part of the BFP community? MK: I hope to increase the scope of my knowledge of what is going on in this space. The inclusive business world can sometimes be an echo chamber of the same stories floating around for years. So what I like about BFP is that many of the stories are different. I hope you will continue to bring in more of the non-usual suspects. Editor&#8217;s Note: Thank you to Mike Kubzansky for taking the time to do this interview.

20819,Suzanne Dagseven,https://businessfightspoverty.org/suzanne-dagseven,"BFP: What do you do? SD: I started working in international development in Australia with AusAID. When I worked there, I developed a strategy and lead a team to expand Australia’s aid to Africa from nine to fifty-three countries. I saw the benefits of that and thought the government-to-government effort was great, but seeing things in the field I felt that a business-led approach really empowered communities and was more sustainable. I came to work on inclusive business with the International Business Leaders Forum in London. This was a great opportunity to work with multinationals and domestic companies in different emerging markets on inclusive business models that fight poverty in a commercially viable way. I found that inclusive business was often just project based and I was more interested in how to create companies that pursue social good in every area of their business. The answer to this is really about people: the company’s leadership, culture, structure and values. My partner and I started an organisation called OrgBooster, which helps companies put sustainability at the heart of their business so it flows through everything that they do. We talk about helping companies create value from values. BFP: What is the best part about your job? SD:The best part is seeing the commercial and social benefits that can be created when companies put sustainability at the core of their business. There are so many win-win outcomes when business addresses social and environmental issues, and that includes helping their own bottom line directly and indirectly. We know, for example, that a well-executed sustainability strategy can help companies tap into new markets, reduce risks and costs, innovate, enhance their brand and increase trust. It also helps companies attract and retain talent at a time when they are facing talent shortages. Most people these days want to work for a company that does good in the world, and companies that can do this well will attract the best people. Having also worked on the development side, I know the development industry can gain a lot from working with business and adopting market-driven approaches. BFP: What have been your greatest challenges? SD: When working in a development agency the biggest challenge was overcoming the cultural barriers and the mind-set of working with business and seeing them as a legitimate partner in development. On the company side, the biggest challenge is helping managers see the crucial link between people and sustainability. Sustainability is often seen as an operational or technical issue, but it’s actually organisational. Many companies I worked with on inclusive business said their biggest challenges were in the organisation itself &#8211; how well the company innovates and how well they could get management and other internal stakeholders involved in the initiative. We need to think about how to get these things right. Without that, pro-poor business will never reach real scale. BFP: How have you overcome these challenges?/ What advice, would you give to others? What is the secret of your success? SD: At an organisational level working with senior managers and leaders in both companies and development agencies to develop the right culture. They’re the ones that really make the decisions and role model the behaviours that set how the organisation works. That’s the key way to overcome these challenges. This then trickles down into everything that the company does. The difficulty in getting things through to all levels really depends on how the whole organisation sees its role in the world, the values it has and its capacity to work in new ways with new partners. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do, where should they start? SD: If you want to ‘bridge the cultural divide’, working in different sectors such as business, government and non-government agencies is good to build an understanding of how each of these different actors think and operate. More broadly, in one’s own career, it’s about following your heart and being true to your values. Which sounds like a cliché, but if you love what you do every day, you perform at your best and ultimately that’s the best thing, not only for your career, but also for yourself. BFP: Finally, what do you hope to get out of being part of the BFP community? SD: One of the best things about BFP is getting examples of the real innovations on the ground that come when business addresses social issues. It’s great to see those win-win outcomes that are both commercial and social. Another thing that BFP does that is very unique and important is building bridges between different sectors, so that people who work in development agencies can see the positive role business plays, business can connect with the world of development agencies, and civil society actors can be engaged on both sides. BFP has a very unique role where it can straddle these different sectors and bring people together around a shared agenda that is really important for the world. And last but not least, connecting with people who are also passionate about making a difference. Editor&#8217;s Note: Thank you to Suzanne Dagseven for taking the time to do this interview.

20822,Simon Maxwell,https://businessfightspoverty.org/simon-maxwell-cbe,"BFP: What do you do? SM: This sounds like the question the Queen might ask if you were to meet her at a garden party! The answer, Your Majesty, is that I ‘do’ international development, and have been ‘doing’ for forty years: ten years overseas in Kenya, India and Bolivia, then sixteen years at IDS in Sussex, then 12 years as Director of ODI in London, and now a portfolio livelihood. The portfolio includes: Executive Chair of the Climate and Development Knowledge Network, a $US 100m fund established by the UK and Dutch Governments to support climate compatible development through technical cooperation, research and knowledge management (www.cdkn.org ); head of a European development cooperation programme at ODI (www.international-development.eu); specialist adviser to the UK House of Commons International Development Select Committee; and occasional moderator of debates for Business Fights Poverty. I have a large number of pro bono engagements, including with the Fair Trade Foundation, the Institute of Public Policy Research, FRIDE (a Spanish think-tank) and the World Economic Forum. More details at www.simonmaxwell.eu. BFP: What is the best part about your job? SM:The sense of urgency and excitement of being involved in something that can make a difference to the lives of the world’s poorest people. Poverty and hunger have fallen sharply since 1970, when I started, access to health and education have improved, communications are better, gender equality is a bit better. I don’t know that the development industry can claim much credit, let alone the development research industry, and there is a great deal left to do. There are also many new challenges, like climate change. But, we should not let cassandras rule the day: it’s OK to be optimistic about the development enterprise. BFP: What has been your greatest challenge? SM: Personally, I am passionate about building bridges between research and policy. The famous psychologist, Kurt Lewin, once said that ‘there is nothing so practical as a good theory’. True. But good thinking is not automatically practical. Research evidence is only useful when it is presented in readable form, at the right time, and to the right people. That is why I love working in and with think-tanks: the best of them build and support policy communities which bring researchers and policy-makers together; and know how to tread the thin line between academic irrelevance and partisan advocacy. By the way, Business Fights Poverty works brilliantly in this space, bringing people together, sharing knowledge, and building bridges between businesses, researchers, NGOs and policy-makers. BFP: How have you overcome these challenges? SM:People working in think-tanks need four key sets of skills: as story tellers, turning complex research into practical policy recommendations; as networkers, so that they have the contacts to disseminate their findings; as engineers, constantly thinking about implementation, building progress on the ground; and as ‘fixers’, sensitive to and engaged in the politics of the policy process. I have four role models: Sheherezade as a story-teller; Paul Revere (who used his networks to raise the militia against the British) as a networker; Isambard Kingdom Brunel as the engineer; and Rasputin as the fixer. One other thing about bridging research and policy is that it no longer makes sense to work in one country at a time, when so many of the world’s big problems (climate change again) need joint action across national boundaries. I’ve worked to build alliances of think-tanks, like the European Think-Tanks Group, which has members in five countries. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do, where should they start? SM: I’m tempted to say: be the Grand Vizier’s daughter, like Sheherezade, or become a monk, like Rasputin. More practically, institutions like ODI are recruiting all the time – and the average age when I left was under 35. They look for people with exceptional research skills and training, though not necessarily a PhD, combined with exceptional communication skills. Field experience in a developing country is highly desirable, not least because it helps give a sense of what is and is not possible in the policy realm. BFP: Finally, what do you hope to get out of being part of this community? SM: Business can get it terribly wrong with respect to development, but can also get it right: creating jobs, building supply chains, protecting the environment, supporting communities, and encouraging transparency and good business practice. Sometimes the champions are international companies, sometimes local. Often, they are supported by innovative policy frameworks and finance, and by progressive donors. For me, Business Fights Poverty has been an invaluable source of inspiration and learning: sharing good practice, but also challenging all the stakeholders to improve the quality of evidence.

20825,Katleen Felix,https://businessfightspoverty.org/katleen-felix,"BFP: What do you do? KF: I chair the Haitian Hometown Associations Resource Group (HHTARG) and I am the Project Director and Diaspora Liaison Officer for Fonkoze, where I am responsible for research and development for new remittance products and initiatives, financial literacy programs for new immigrants, training and capacity-building for Haitian Hometown Associations (HHTAs), project reporting, and donor relations. My most recent project is Zafèn The idea of Zafèn came out of a videoconference on financial literacy organized with diaspora leaders in Miami, New York and Haiti in April 2009. After brainstorming about what was affecting the Haitian community abroad financially, diaspora leaders recognized that investing in Haiti was not easy. In fact, it was a burden on the community. They were losing money on their investments because of a lack of knowledge about the Haitian investment situation, and they were unable to follow up on their investments. They asked Fonkoze to set up a website where they could find out about sustainable businesses in their hometown that would create jobs and have social impact in the community. At the time, as I jotted down the action items to be shared with MIF (Multilateral Investment Fund, our donor for this project), I couldn’t help thinking “How on earth are we going to deliver that?” Well, somehow the stars aligned, and a miracle happened: two months later, Anne Hastings, CEO of Fonkoze Financial Services, informed me that the Vincentian familywas very interested in the idea of setting up a website to support SMEs in Haiti. BFP: What is the best part about your job? KF: The best part is seeing meaningful results. For example, Zafèn has been online for only 2 years, and we now have over 1500 online users from all around the globe. They’ve invested over $1 million in more than 140 projects. Over 760 jobs have been created, and many businesses have received technical assistance to help stimulate their growth. BFP: What has been your greatest challenge? KF: We were fortunate to have partners like the Vincentian family and DePaul University, who helped jump-start the program as part of their celebration of the legacies of St. Vincent de Paul and St. Louise de Marillac 350 years after their deaths. The initial grants from IADB, HIFIVE(USAID), Oxfam, MercyCorp, Zynga and the Clinton Bush Haiti Fund were instrumental to build capacity and helped us go beyond the online platform. It has been a challenge to find funding to pay for the day-to-day administration of Zafèn and training or business support for the businesses. Access to finance is not the only element of success for the SMEs and SGBs; we need to find donors who are willing to finance the back office of Zafèn until it gets to the point where it is sustainable. It is a hard thing to sell. Most of our individual donors give loans, but they’re not as inclined to make a donation to underwrite the administrative functions. We are getting great results because of a proven approach tested in the past 2 years. BFP: How have you overcome these challenges? What advice would you give to others? KF:Since our resources are limited, we need to find partners who share our values and are in Haiti for the long run. With those partners we want to build a sustainable ecosystem of business development providers for our Zafèn clients. We also use professionals from the Haitian Diaspora to help with staffing and training. For example, with some members of the HHTARG we organized training on value chains, guest house management, sustainable schools, aqua farming, business plan drafting, accounting, and finance. Also we are always looking for pro-bono or low-bono professionals or firms who can help with Zafèn’s administration. For example, last year we were fortunate to have Tronvig Group help us with our social media campaign and our new webpage. They also produced this great video explaining how Zafèn works: BFP: If someone wants to do what you do – where do they start? KF:To do what I do you need to have a strong professional background and experience with community service. I have 10 years of experience in corporate finance and over 20 years of involvement with Haitian Hometown Associations and community services. I think the first step is to get involved as a volunteer or intern to understand the challenges, and then start solving them. I would also recommend joining networks like Women Advancing Microfinance (WAM) or Aspen Network of Development of Entrepreneurs (ANDE) to meet other professionals working in the field and get a grasp of their reality. They also publish research papers and host conferences that could be useful. BFP: And lastly, what do you hope to get out of being part of this community? KF: Mostly, I hope to learn from others’ experiences. I really enjoy reading the blogs and articles posted on Business Fights Poverty. I’m also interested in corporate social responsibility and finding business solutions to social issues. That’s one of the other reasons I joined this community.

KM: I recently joined the Global Communications and Public Affairs team at Google.org &#8211; a part of Google that brings together Google’s people and resources to tackle global challenges. Working in communications, my job is to help tell the Google.org story to different audiences, from tech reporters to non-profit leaders to Google users. There’s also a broader message that goes beyond Google.org, which is the potential for tech to be a key ingredient in impact solutions. This was true for my previous role as well—I spent five years at Omidyar Network, the philanthropic investment firm created by eBay founder Pierre Omidyar and his wife Pam. At Omidyar, there was also a real emphasis on entrepreneurs who are using technology in new and exciting ways to improve lives. BFP: What is the best part about your job? KM: For one, it’s working with very smart, driven people who focus their energies on having an impact in the world. I learn something every day. My work also offers some brand new territory. It’s exciting to work at a place that isn’t afraid to try things, and with people who are really focused on having impact, whether they work for a funder or a tech company. Working at the intersection of non-profit and for-profit, I’ve seen a bit of a shift in how people think about social impact, whether it’s the rise of impact investing, technology for development, or companies extending their social impact beyond CSR and weaving it into their core business. All these things point to a great positive trajectory, because business really is a critical ingredient to sustainable change. There’s definitely a movement to embrace the Silicon Valley culture of iteration and innovation and apply that model to doing good. It’s a great story to share. Plus, I get to work with organizations that really inspire, like African Leadership Academy, which is educating Africa’s young leaders and has been funded by both Omidyar and Google.org. BFP: What have been your greatest challenges? KM: One of the biggest challenges in communications is working to convey a complex idea in a simple, understandable way. It’s easy to get caught up in the jargon and the complexity of big, systemic problems&#8211; the different players in an ecosystem, the root causes, the different levers to drive change. You have to take a step back– what are trying to do and how do we communicate that in a clear way. Presenting it so that someone can read about what a company is doing and say- okay, I get that, I understand. You don’t want to oversimplify. Achieving that balance can be a struggle, but when you get the message right, your audience can hopefully learn and be inspired. BFP: How have you overcome these challenges? What advice, would you give to others? KM: At Google or Omidyar Network or a startup using tech to have an impact, the solution or idea might be technical or complicated, but ultimately a non-technical audience should be able to read about and understand what you’re doing. For example, Kiva brought the message of Microfinance to the masses. At the time, it was a novel idea for many, and a different way to think about changing lives. It’s also valuable to connect with others working in similar areas, communities like Business Fights Poverty and convenings like SOCAP here in the Bay area that address a mixed for-profit/non-profit audience. Find people who are willing to share war stories and success stories. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do, where would they start? KM: A communications role is great for someone who loves to write, to tell stories, to be a bit of a translator. I didn’t initially set out to work in philanthropy or using tech for social impact, but it helped that my education was in English and business, and I had a lot of passion for the work. You really can’t network enough in this space, because the jobs might be rare or come up suddenly. Also, if you want to work in a place that is non-traditional in how they view social change, they might also be non-traditional in how they hire. So be ambitious about how you can apply your skills. Before I joined Omidyar Network, I had no non-profit experience, but I had background in business, technology and marketing, which together were relevant. You can often thread together your own background, maybe even volunteer experiences, in a way that makes you a good fit for a role, rather than focus on the perfect or ideal path to get there. BFP: Finally, what do you hope to get out of being part of the BFP community? KM: I like reading the cases, it helps me think differently about the kinds of stories that are interesting. You get very focused on your own business, and it’s important to hear what others are doing. It’s a good reminder of how many other entrepreneurs, companies, funders are out there working on the same issues.

20832,Anita Yang,https://businessfightspoverty.org/anita-yang,"BFP: What do you do? I am a consultant based in London. For the past year, I have been part of the Virgin Unite team, the non-profit foundation of the Virgin Group in the Business Development &amp; Investments Team, where many of Virgin Unite’s leadership initiatives get developed and launched. I have been working on how we can utilise our voice and resources to support entrepreneurs. This includes building from the experience of the Branson Centres of Entrepreneurship (in South Africa and the Caribbean) to develop new markets and models of delivering entrepreneurial learning &#8211; from how to enable access to capital for young entrepreneurs to developing a platform that provides access to mentors and other support services entrepreneurs need to grow their businesses. I guess you can say in some ways we are an in-house incubator. At Virgin Unite, we always look at ways to catalyse partnerships whether it is with our Virgin businesses, supporters, external influencers or local partners – to bring together resources and people to address some big challenges. A lot of my work leverages my previous experience in Asia where I worked for a boutique company which created partnerships between social enterprises and potential investors including corporations who had an interest in in expanding their presence in emerging markets. BFP: What is the best part about your job? I really enjoy taking big ideas and making them happen. At Virgin Unite, we are encouraged to think like entrepreneurs, which is quite a shift from the traditional philanthropic approach. It helps that I have some very smart and talented colleagues who come from the private sector. My work involves identifying key market gaps and developing solutions which Virgin Unite and the wider Virgin Group are uniquely positioned to address, as well as examining ways that initiatives become sustainable through opportunities for income generation. Our entrepreneurial environment is very much aligned to my belief that commercial solutions and collaboration with the private sector is critical given the urgency of some of the challenges the world is facing. BFP: What have been your greatest challenges? Taking big ideas and making them happen! This is challenging especially when you get a lot of great ideas or ways to approach things &#8211; it becomes an art form to get consensus. The other challenge that we, like many organisations, face is measuring the impact of the work we do and putting numbers behind the story. There is no perfect way of doing it and significant resources as well as long-term thinking are needed to get it done properly. BFP: How have you overcome these challenges?/ What advice, would you give to others? On making things happen, I think it is critical from the start to get clear during the planning process: What gap it is that you are seeking to fill Why are you and your organization doing it How you will do it differently What impact it is that you seek to make If you are clear about these things, the project has a much better chance of succeeding. It is also a lot easier to get critical buy-in from your stakeholders when you can articulate what your project will achieve and how. This is the perfect time to develop those impact metrics – from the start. One of the big things I’ve learned is how much harder it is to track impact when a project or activity is in progress. Taking the time now to get a proper framework and process in place saves a lot of pain down the road. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do, where should they start? Start with being unreasonable and being persistent. I got my first job at an established international development agency by simply speaking with a lot of people, following up on leads and showing my enthusiasm. Internships are also a great way to get into an organization and to explore what things interest you or what you may be good at. Finding a mentor who works in the sector you want to be in also opens a lot of doors and can give you the insight about what sort of skill sets or knowledge you may need to develop to further yourself in your career. There has also been an incredible shift in the last few years with many development organizations hiring people with private sector experience. With resource and funding cuts across the sector, all organizations are looking for people who can think innovatively, generate new income streams and increase efficiencies &#8211; important skills sets and experience that a corporate executive can bring to the table. BFP: Finally: what do you hope to get out of being part of the BFP community? Meeting more interesting and diverse people doing innovative work and bringing their learning and insight into the work that I do. So far the BFP events that I have attended have been a great learning and networking platform and I look forward to being more engaged in the future.

20856,Katharine Teague,https://businessfightspoverty.org/katharine-teague,"BFP: What do you do? KT: I am the Senior Private Sector Adviser at Christian Aid &#8211; my role consists of developing policy positions and advocating to companies and government on issues related to business and poverty. At the moment my business engagement is predominantly focused on our Tax and Climate Change/Sustainability campaigns. At Christian Aid we believe that businesses, from the largest to the smallest have a crucial part to play in ending the scandal of poverty. We seek to partner with the private sector at a global and local level to develop more enlightened business practices and create fair and enterprising markets. Part of my job is to challenge and expose the unjust structural rules and negative business practices that keep people poor – with the aim of maximising the positive contribution that business can make to poverty reduction. This is achieved through engaging with and working to influence companies’ policies and practices, and the regulatory environment within which business operates. BFP: What is the best part about your job? KT: The best part of my job is working with colleagues, partners and business who are dedicated to challenging injustices and finding solutions which assist people who are living in poverty. I also love the diversity of my job – I am incredibly lucky that I am able to work on policy and advocacy related to tax, climate change, CSR and our enterprise-based development programmatic work. BFP: What have been your greatest challenges? KT: Over the last couple of decades there has been unprecedented economic development across the globe which has exacerbated the scale and reach of poverty and subsequent inequality &#8211; I think that the biggest challenge for someone in my job is to convince and demonstrate to people that business and international development can be good bedfellows. Economic development and the motivations of business are not all for self-interest but there can be a constructive engagement which will result in a transformational set of outcomes for society. It is important in my job to continue challenging business and the regulators to create an environment where a positive impact is created. BFP: How have you overcome these challenges? What advice, would you give to others? KT: I have a couple of pieces of advice &#8211; I consider that it is important to build relationships and forge constructive dialogue as well as being realistic on how long things take to happen. Building relationships is crucial in understanding everyone’s point of view – even if it is not your own. Each actor is facing different challenges and these conditions dictate their ability to act, so only through constructive dialogue can you start to address challenges, develop confidence and understand everyone’s point of view so that solutions can be found – this takes time. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do, where should they start? KT: It is important that you are very passionate about international development and want to challenge the structures that keep people poor. This job is very rewarding but it is going to be a long battle and so you must really want to undertake a career in this environment. I can only speak from my own experience but I would suggest that working in the private sector is a good idea alongside spending time in developing countries working on programmes or projects to show to show commitment. In addition I have a Master’s degree in International Public Policy from UCL so I would recommend an academic qualification with a development focus. BFP: Finally, what do you hope to get out of being part of the BFP community? KT: BFP is an amazing resource which enables me to meet like-minded people. It gives me the opportunity to attend events and learn from other people’s experiences. Alongside learning from others it is a really good forum to showcase your projects and for me to contribute expertise that Christian Aid has on international development.

20859,Pedro Eikelenboom,https://businessfightspoverty.org/pedro-eikelenboom,"BFP: What do you do? PE: I am a Senior Advisor Partnerships at the Sustainable Trade Initiative (IDH) in The Netherlands. The Dutch government has granted from it’s development budget IDH with € 105 million for the period 2011-2015 to forge public private partnerships that transform international markets towards sustainability. Focusing on key commodities in the agro and food sector, IDH convenes and invests through their current portfolio of 16 commodity programs in over 50 countries, hereby involving over 200 businesses, 35 civil society actors and government agencies. My role is to engage partners and mobilize resources to support our initiative in the up scaling of international commodity supply chains. At IDH we build coalitions with local governments, the private sector and the civil society community, with the public goods on poverty alleviation, food security, private sector development and the strengthening of local capacity building institutions in developing countries. Our focus is on transforming the most common commodity supply chains, such as cotton, cocoa, coffee, timber, tea etc, that have huge impact on environment, production and trade worldwide. IDH partners with multinationals like Adidas, Ahold, Barry-Callebaut, Nestle, Unilever, Mars, to that are committed to sustainable sourcing and see sustainability as their core strategy. Ultimately looking at how we can transform a whole commodity sector. Some of these large corporate organizations have set ambitious targets regarding sustainable cocoa, coffee, palm oil etc. and cannot meet these targets alone. IDH is a public-private partnership facility, develops and disseminates innovative strategies of smart transformative supply chain models which we match fund on a 1:1 ratio with private investments in our sector programs. We look at how to include small holders in developing countries into a global supply chain and thereby helping to address the Millennium Development Goals 1, 7 and 8. Core of our work is to ensure local private sector development, thus boosting economic activity in the beginning of the supply chains, and ensuring ecological sustainability, partly through creating higher productivity on less land. BFP: What is the best part about your job? PE: The best part of my job is that I am pioneering in what I do. My role consists of pioneering, engaging and forging partnerships with other stakeholders to join our approach, hereby leveraging more investments into sustainable supply chain transformation. Create impact with less is key now a days, and therefore donor alignment is a topic widely discussed in Europe and also the US. We’re engaging different stakeholders as partners to our value proposition. I enjoy investigating new markets and identify opportunities for cooperation, hereby creating impact to developing countries. Understanding as to speak the language of the diverse stakeholder field is important as challenging in my job. In general, the pioneering aspect is the best part of the job. BFP: What have been your greatest challenges? PE: The greatest challenge, not only at IDH, but also in my previous roles at the Inter-American Development Bank and the Dutch NGO ICCO, is how to convince other stakeholders when you don’t have a long track record. In our field of work it can be difficult to show results. Results are often fragmented or not always feasible. The challenge is how to convince others of the added value so that they are willing to join you. Getting people to see a process, model, or strategy as success or having the potential to be a success, hereby enabling systemic impact through multi stakeholder engagement. This convincing part can be very difficult, but one has to believe to sell the proposition. You have different points of view and objectives, looking at the private sector, NGOs, governments and other organizations have their experience, established results and impact. The challenge is working out how to align these interests and priorities all together and co-develop a strategy to tackle the challenges in the supply chains. BFP: How have you overcome these challenges? What advice, would you give to others? PE: Being honest and enabling trust by being a neutral facilitator. It’s important that everybody from the different stakeholder backgrounds take ownership in the initiative. Everyone has to have a say and have their input into the program. This helps build trust as all parties have contributed to the process and then all have ownership and feel the commitment to stick to the program and make results happen. Ownership is key. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do, where should they start? PE: During my career I have worked in the private sector, for an NGO, and at a multilateral bank. This has all been valuable experience as I have learnt to understand how each of these sectors thinks and talks. I can relate to them and understand their point of view and this helps me to convince them to join us. It’s important to gain experience in different sectors. My role at IDH is actually the sum of all the experience and knowledge I’ve gained so far, where I interact with all these different stakeholders on a global scale. It’s a challenging role, but perfect for me. BFP: Finally: what do you hope to get out of being part of the BFP community? PE: I hope to learn from others, particularly about new ways of thinking, new approaches on poverty alleviation and how business can be included in solutions to socio economic challenges worldwide. It’s a good place for discussions that can trigger you to think differently and look at new models in this area. Business Fights Poverty helps me to make links with other organisations, that could be a simple discussion or depending on our views, link further with each other around how can we achieve more impact on poverty alleviation. I also enjoy reading the articles published and looking into the discussions that are happening on the forum, it teaches me a lot about what’s going on and with whom I can connect and interact with.

20862,Rhoda Wilson,https://businessfightspoverty.org/rhoda-wilson,"BFP: What do you do? RW: I run my own independent production company called Cetstar Ltd that currently produces a choice of programmes ranging from documentaries to online videos, as well as my television show on Sky TV called The Rhoda Wilson Show. The show is all about inspiring people to a smarter life. Across a wide mix of subject matter, guests are selected with the central theme of inspiration and motivation. The show consists of interviews based on the lives of inspirational and growing talent across the UK and African Diasporas in Europe. On the 30 minute show, guests share their inspiring stories and lessons learnt along the way. I am also passionate about SMEs as they are the backbone of our economy. My show has a popular online SME Promotion segment on YouTube, which provides individual SMEs with a platform to a much wider audience, increasing their visibility. BFP: What is the best part about your job? RW: I love my job. It is where I want to be. It’s where I believe my talents and my skills meet my passion. I love meeting people, hearing about their stories. In addition, I learn so much from all my guests on the show. It is inspiring to meet people who tell you what they have been through and how they overcame their challenges. BFP: What have been your greatest challenges? RW: I started out in the music industry running large concerts and moved from this to working on the small screen. It was not an easy transition to TV. The hardest stage was developing my business, particularly the finance side. You rely on advertising and sponsorship to cover your production costs. Getting people to sponsor me and help finance the production company was far from an easy process. To begin with I did a lot of the work myself, sourced cameras, did the research, scripting. I searched all over for people who could do the editing and producing. I didn’t know anything about editing, so I learnt on the job and produced my first pilot having invested what I could and borrowed £675 from a friend. The total invested was a seriously small amount of money for a television production, but this was all I had. This was all people were prepared to give me at the time. I wasn’t known then and many of the channels turned me away, they said there was no market for this show. Even after our first show we didn’t do another one for almost a year. When you are starting out, not many people will share your dream, but if you really believe in it, you’ll find a way to make it work. I won’t say it was easy; I had to go back to work to keep the show going myself. However, here we are seven years on and we are still going. Back in 2009, I was voted BEST TV Presenter, BEFFTA and since then things have gone from good to better. In 2011, I was named in the top 20 Inspirational Woman of African Diaspora and was head judge for Miss Cameroun beauty pageant also in 2011. I was shortlisted in Wise Women Awards in 2012 and was on the final nominee list for Media Professional of the Year 2012 by Women4Africa. BFP: How have you overcome these challenges? What is the secret of your success? RW: Determination, and you’ve got to be resilient. Whilst people often think money is the most important thing to keep a business going, and to an extent it is, but sometimes the challenges you face as a business do not need money to make them go away, you’ve just got to find a creative way to overcome them. You have to be focused and you have to have self-belief. Speak to trusted people about your challenges, I have found inspiration can come from unexpected sources! BFP: If someone wants to do what you do, where should they start? RW: The media industry is an arduous industry to be in, so you must be prepared to work hard. Get practical experience, at an independent production company or a TV channel, where you can learn how the business works. You may need to start by being a runner or a production assistant -these are not particularly glamorous jobs, but they are relevant to keep a production going and you will learn so much from them. As well as practical experience some formal training is also helpful. At a later stage in my career I did a television presenting course and then a production course and I continue to do training at least once a year, to keep my skills fresh. BFP: Finally: what do you hope to get out of being part of the BFP community? RW: I want to support the Business Fights Poverty cause. Whatever is needed from me, if I can do it, I will. This is why I am part of BFP network. Editor&#8217;s Note: Thank you to Rhoda Wilson for taking the time to do this interview.

20865,Dr Jochen Weikert,https://businessfightspoverty.org/dr-jochen-weikert,"BFP: What do you do? JW: I work for GIZ, a federal enterprise, supporting the German Government in achieving its objectives in the field of international cooperation for sustainable development. Most of our work is commissioned by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ). I am a Senior Manager in the Private Sector Cooperation unit, working on policy development at the interface of business and development. We work closely with develoPPP.de the BMZ flagship programme to promote cooperation between business and development agencies. BFP: What is the best part about your job? JW:The best part of my job is inspiring policy makers, when I recognize my own ideas in polices that are taking shape. The impact of our work is not always easy to pinpoint, so seeing policies emerge that are from your own thoughts is very rewarding. BFP: What have been your greatest challenges? JW: Early on in my career one of my most challenging projects was the organisation of a side event to the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) + 5 summit. We gathered all the major players and thinkers working on business and development at one large conference. It was very challenging, in particular dealing with all the politics involved in organizing such a global conference. Everyone wanted to be there and be visible, with many having their own agendas and private plans of how to make this happen. BFP: How have you overcome these challenges? What is the secret of your success? JW: It is essential to be able to work with the dynamics that occur in policy making, anticipating how different organisations and people enforce their interests, and how they will best come together. When you have many people in the room with 50 or so different interests and time constraints you need to learn to develop a sense of the pattern the policy making will take. With this understanding you can play with those complex dynamics for the best outcome. The most important part is communicating, I communicate in various forms all day long- so you need to like it! In the case of the MDG + 5 side event, the trick was to offer an open platform, by inviting everyone to come and showcase their work and share knowledge we ended up with a high quality dynamic audience. This was a valuable experience to have early on in my career as it taught me the complexities at play in the facilitation of large-scale global conferences and policy making. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do, where should they start? JW: Firstly I’d say pick a topic that inspires you, and study it in more detail. During my early studies, I was intrigued by why businesses, who are traditionally all about profit, were now talking about these “soft” issues, I wanted to understand where this had come from and learn more about it. To further my studies I did a postgraduate course at the German Development Institute (GDI). The GDI is a public think tank on development issues, funded by the German government, as part of their work they train about 20 people a year for jobs in official development organizations. It is a good path to take if you wanted to work somewhere like GIZ. A similar course is the Global Governance School, where GIZ invites young professionals from BRIC countries who are working in ministries or think tanks etc. to study at the school. If you are also interested in how the private sector of emerging economies can contribute to international development this GIZ study entitled “Fast Growth and Big Impacts: How Emerging Market Multinationals are&#8230;” is a good read. BFP: Finally: what do you hope to get out of being part of the BFP community? JW: It is valuable being part of Business Fights Poverty and connected to many people within the area of business and development. There is a high probability that I will bump into the people that are members of the network during my work, so it is good to be connected in some way. I don’t necessarily play a central role on BFP, but I do watch what is happening on key topics and read many of the articles- particularly those on the base of the pyramid.

20868,Paul Polak,https://businessfightspoverty.org/paul-polak,"BFP: What do you do? PP: I create global companies designed to reach 100 million customers who live on two dollars a day, generate ten billion a year in sales and earn attractive profits. BFP: What is the best part about your job/project? PP: It&#8217;s incredibly exciting addressing problems that most people think are impossible to solve. BFP: What has been your greatest challenge? PP: Attracting investors. Surprisingly many social venture capitol investors are not ready to make high risk early start up in investments in companies than can make the most transformative scalable impact if successful. BFP: How have you overcome these challenges? PP: In addition to attracting investors that can make transformative scalable impact, there are many challenges. The first is that the design has to fit the needs of customers who are often in remote rural villages. The answer is so simple that people don&#8217;t want to do it &#8211; go the the village, talk to a lot of the customers there and find out what they need. The second challenge is designing products that are cheap enough and effective enough to be attractive to two dollar a day customers. I have described the ruthless pursuit of affordability and what that it takes to get there in my book, “Out of Poverty”. The third is being able to cross the last five hundred feet in distribution. Spring Health the drinking water company I&#8217;ve started has figured out how to do this (more on how to cross the last 500 feet can be found in this blog post) The Fourth is how to reach meaningful scale which I define as reaching one hundred million customers for each company. The Fifth is aspirational branding. Poor customers have hopes and dreams even more than rich customers and without effective aspirational branding you can&#8217;t reach scale with two dollar a day customers. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do – where do they start? PP: Go to where the action is, talk to the people who have the problem and listen to what they have to say and learn everything there is to know about the specific context of the problem. BFP: What do you hope to get out of being part of this community? PP: To see more businesses that are are profitable and help hundreds of millions of people move out of poverty. Editor&#8217;s Note: Thank you to Paul Polak for taking the time to do this interview. For the past 25 years, Paul has worked with thousands of farmers in countries around the world—including Bangladesh, India, Cambodia, Ethiopia, Myanmar, Nepal, Vietnam, Zambia and Zimbabwe–to help design and produce low–cost, income–generating products that have already moved 17 million people out of poverty.

20873,Karen Smith,https://businessfightspoverty.org/karen-smith,"BFP: What do you do? KS:I work for Imani Development, a private economic and development consultancy firm rooted in the developing world that facilitates the process of economic growth and poverty reduction. I am currently managing the Business Innovation Facility (BIF) project, a DFID funded inclusive business pilot initiative in Malawi. My role as Country Manager is to identify IB opportunities and set up technical support projects to move these initiatives forward. We are two thirds of the way through the project and have found and instigated eighteen projects with a broad range of clients including the private sector, NGOs and social enterprises. There is inevitably a strong focus on agro-processing, given that Malawi’s economy is dominated by agriculture, and there are also several renewable energy / climate change projects. BFP: What is the best part about your job? KS:I am constantly meeting new organisations and inspiring entrepreneurs and intrapreneurs who are full of ideas and enthusiasm to grow businesses in Malawi that incorporate the poor in their value chain. The variety is really stimulating and I get a real buzz from being able to link people to information, markets or potential customers or partners. BFP: What have been your greatest challenges? KS: The greatest challenge to the project has been the extremely difficult economic conditions in Malawi over the past two years. The international aid community pulled away as the government became more autocratic and the over-valued currency lead to the instigation of an impossible “zero-deficit” budget. The result has been crippling to the private sector with increased taxes, a lengthy fuel crisis and limited access to FOREX. The problems lead to one of our projects being aborted and several others have been severely challenged as companies have been operating in survival mode. BFP: How have you overcome these challenges? KS: Fortunately recent events have lead to the appointment of a new president who has taken immediate action to rectify the underlying issues, such as devaluing the Malawi Kwacha and welcoming back donors. In the interim, I have been inspired by the stamina and determination of our project clients to push forwards with their innovative ideas. In fact it could be argued that the lack of FOREX in particular has forced companies to focus their energy on import substitution and export product innovations, many of which involve smallholders in the supply chain. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do, where should they start? KS: I came into development late in my career from a more general management background. I think that the understanding of business that I gained from my MBA, my project management experience and analytical skills have been key to delivering a private sector focused donor programme such as BIF. I would advocate private sector experience as a start point and then experience on the ground in a developing country to see how development does (and doesn’t!) work firsthand. BFP: Finally: what do you hope to get out of being part of the BFP community? KS: As BIF comes into its final year as a pilot project we are looking to the future and hoping that DFID sees the benefits of engaging the private sector to achieve development goals. I hope to be able to both share lessons that we have learnt with a wider audience and also network with those doing similar work to continue being able to link social entrepreneurs and projects between countries.

20876,Lewis Temple,https://businessfightspoverty.org/lewis-temple,"BFP: What do you do? LT: I’m the CEO of iDE UK. iDE is a global partnership of organisations that all share the same mission to create income and livelihood opportunities for the rural poor. Founded 30 years ago by Paul Polak, iDE is a network of organisations in the UK, Canada and the USA with programmes running across 11 countries in Africa and Asia. iDE UK develops partnerships and programmes to further our mission. The iDE approach worldwide is to use market-based approaches to address the fundamental barriers to poverty reduction and livelihood improvement for the poorest. In our experience of over 30 years of work in Sub-Saharan Africa and Asia, agricultural growth does not come from aid but by enabling small farmers to produce and sell cash crops in the market place. In the early 80s Paul Polak spent a lot of time learning from subsistence farmers about how they most effectively increase their incomes. The key conclusion was that the best way was to grow high value produce &#8211; such as vegetables &#8211; for market in the dry season when prices were at their highest. In order to achieve this, farmers need access to water for irrigation. This insight led to the development of interventions that work with the local private sector to make available low cost irrigation technologies through the market, helping small-scale farmers produce higher value crops. They can then sell those crops in the market at a profit, earning extra income &#8211; sometimes as much as doubling their incomes in the first season. iDE works with farmers as customers rather than beneficiaries of charity. We see the farmers as entrepreneurs in their own right and we support local enterprises to deliver the products and services smallholder farmers need to haul themselves out of food insecurity, transforming subsistence farming into production for the market at a profit. This can include income generating products as well as advisory services – such as the Farm Business Advisors model. Over the last ten years we have also taken this market driven approach to other sectors – and now have a rapidly growing portfolio in water and sanitation such as the ‘Easy Latrine’in Cambodia. BFP: What is the best part about your job? LT: Undoubtedly, spending time with farmers in their fields or homestead and learning about their lives and their businesses. BFP: What have been your greatest challenges? LT: The pervasive ‘giveaway’ culture in the development community undermines the development of local businesses. We sometimes work for years to support the development of a market and then someone will come along and just give away what we have been supporting local businesses to sell. Despite the increasing recognition that giving things away is non-sustainable, it can be tempting when organisations are under pressure to reach targets. However, any analysis of results shows giveaways rarely bring sustainable benefits in the long term. BFP: How have you overcome these challenges? What is the secret of your success? LT: The secret of iDE’s success is 1) always using a customer-orientated approach. It is essential to listen to the farmers and understand their businesses; we do not regard them as beneficiaries of charity but businesses in their own right. 2) To understand and work through markets to enable farmers to become self-sustaining money-making businesses. The development of profitable businesses is the key to reaching scale. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do, where should they start? LT: Go visit developing countries and work on the ground there. You need to go where the action is, visit the farmers’ fields and talk with farmers, learn from them. My background is in social anthropology and I have mainly worked for NGOs. The common thread in my career has been the focus on reaching scale. The first NGO I worked for operated in the former Soviet Union and Central Asia. We worked with governments to develop new social services for children and families – and reached scale through the ability of government to roll out services nationwide. Later I worked for an NGO in Africa and reached scale through large aid programmes. However, I felt that the impact was largely in the short term and not really changing the game. As a result of these experiences I was attracted to iDE and the contribution to development using a business-to-business approach – and reaching scale through the market. BFP: Finally: what do you hope to get out of being part of the BFP community? LT: There are over 800 million small farms in the developing world and we are not going to reach all of these alone! We need to work together, share experience and develop partnerships. Business Fights Poverty is a fantastic resource that can enable this to happen. It’s a meeting place where we can learn from each other and explore partnerships, helping us reach the scale required to tackle the challenges and take advantage of the opportunities that are out there.

20879,Ling Ling Phung,https://businessfightspoverty.org/ling-ling-phung,"BFP: What do you do? LP: I lead corporate entrepreneurship initiatives in emerging markets, specifically focused on Africa and BoP. This work includes designing projects that bring sustainable solutions to development challenges while contributing to core business targets. The NBU incubates new ideas and businesses to create new markets and capabilities for Unilever. All of the BoP projects aim to bring a market based solution to an entrenched development challenge as a way to better serve our consumers, require working with public/social sector partners, and do not fit into the normal business model of a large corporate entity. BFP: What is the best part about your job? LP:Demonstrating how ‘doing good’ for communities can also be ‘doing good’ for business and vice versa. BFP: What have been your greatest challenges? LP: Synching up ways of working between public/social sector partners and Unilever. Even if we share the same mission there are often different ways of working, decision making, and pace. All of the challenges are non-technical, instead they are more about organizational culture and systems. BFP: What advice can you give others facing a similar challenge? LP: It’s really important to have the tough discussions early on in a partnership when working in a public private partnership (PPP). For example, everyone should be very clear about how each party is benefiting from working together, whether profit is made or not, who is paying for what, is everyone comfortable with the use of a brand or not, etc. Also, everyone should be doing what they do best. For example, I always ask, should a business be involved for this work to be successful or are we seen as simply a funding mechanism? Why should Unilever be involved vs. some other corporate? Are we leveraging the core capabilities and strengths of Unilever? Also, why should we be working with this NGO? What gap in capabilities are they filling for this work to be successful? BFP: If someone wants to do what you do, where should they start? LP: They should talk to as many people as possible who are doing what they think they want to do. This could be helpful to figure out what it is about the work you are interested in and what skills you need in order to do the work. It is good to know what drives you, what intentions you have, and finally what you want to contribute to the larger society to make sure those are all internally consistent. BFP: Finally, what do you hope to get out of being part of this community? LP: Learning from others doing similar work and sharing new strategies, ideas, and ways of working.

20882,Corin Mitchell,https://businessfightspoverty.org/corin-mitchell,"BFP: What do you do? CM: I am a Director of KPMG International Development Assistance (IDAS) Services Africa, where I run the Southern Africa portfolio of our African business and Private Sector Development across the whole continent. Our main client base is servicing donors, multilaterals, and bilaterals on various programmes and projects, from design, through delivery to evaluations. I am also the Southern Africa Director of the Africa Enterprise Challenge Fund (AECF) managing the Southern Africa portfolio. My main role is managing and growing our business, with my particular interest being in designing and managing funds that encompass impact investing and inclusive business models. You can read more about the latest AECF fund on agribusiness here. BFP: What is the best part about your job? CM: Cutting through the complexity of development generally, and impact investing and multilateral and bilateral agencies specifically to deliver a difference on the ground. I enjoy the combination of the complex theoretical side of development and the delivery of funds on the ground, which have an impact on poor people and are game changing and life changing. In development it is easy to get extremely theoretical and forget who we are actually trying to benefit, the impact on the ground has to work in reality or we may as well all pack up and go home. BFP: What have been your greatest challenges? CM: Metrics and measurements that are robust enough and demonstrate true and fair development impact. Designing funds and metrics is one thing, however the reality of keeping metrics and measurements practical, both in terms of the time of measurement and cost of doing the measurement, as well as them being believable is a real challenge. The more we move forward, the more the world wants to see metrics. Anecdotal stories have been seen for years and whilst they have their value, skeptics want to know the actual and verifiable metrics the programme is delivering. BFP: How have you overcome these challenges? What is the secret of your success? CM: 1. Strong teams and good talent within programmes. 2. Understanding all the actors and stakeholders that are going to be involved. Explicitly clear and precise communication and agreements are paramount, particularly around metrics and measurements, otherwise focus is decreased and the potential for scope creep dilutes focus and results. 3. It’s important to know the political economy and all the needs of the different stakeholders. 4. Lastly, learn and adapt from doing, particularly when working on multi-year programmes. One can lose sight of why we are measuring and what we are measuring for. It is essential to keep it clear and pick a few key, practical indicators that can be measured. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do, where should they start? CM: A mix of private, public and NGO experience is very helpful and will formulate your understanding of how each of these different groups operate. A masters degree in a subject related to development will be an asset, ideally after 5 or 6 years working experience. Another key ingredient to building a career in development is the experience of living and working in a developing or emerging economy. And lastly, you need a passion for development. Those that deliver best on the ground are passionate about development. It’s important to challenge the norm and shape your own thinking, don’t be fearful to question what has been done over past decades in development, we need to refresh and not just do development as it has always been done. Innovation and technology need to be used even more. We don’t just want ‘reports on shelves’. BFP: Finally: what do you hope to get out of being part of the BFP community? CM: I already get a lot out of Business Fights Poverty and have enjoyed being a part of the community since its conception. It’s clearly a creative and innovative platform where there is online interaction from practitioners and people from different sectors. This cross-linking and cross-thinking is very useful as is the networking with peers and colleagues. I think Business fights Poverty has a huge role to play in strategically engaging and shaping the future of the multi-stakeholder environment we live in. Business Fights Poverty is already doing a lot of really good things, and I encourage you to do more of the same as well as continue to foster innovative thinking and doing.

20885,Rik Overmars,https://businessfightspoverty.org/rik-overmars,"BFP: What do you do? RO: I manage the Mozambique programme of SNV Netherlands Development Organisation. We are an international development organization working in 36 countries in Agriculture, Water,Sanitation &amp; Hygiene and Renewable Energy. SNV applies an Inclusive Business development approach in order to develop value chains which create shared value. We partner with the private sector to build Inclusive Business programmes that establish strategic, long-term, win-win linkages between companies and the BOP either as suppliers, as distributors or as consumers. We have developed a thorough inclusive business advisory practice which now includes over 100 business cases in Latin America, Asia and Africa. From this practice we develop, harvest and disseminate knowledge, in partnerships such as with the World Business Council for Sustainable Development and the Inter-America Development Bank (IADB) (IADB majority markets). In Mozambique our Inclusive Business programme is still quite new. The inclusive business environment is not yet as well-developed here as in some other African countries, such as Kenya or South Africa, and so a lot of our work is laying the groundwork for encouraging more shared value chains and other inclusive models, mostly focusing on outgrower schemes. Upgrading from individual business to whole sub-sectors is enabling us to reach more scale such as in our Ethiopia programme. BFP: What is the best part about your job? RO: Being able to bring the two distinct worlds of business and development together; to challenge conventional thinking; and to get multiple actors of government/public sector/ private sector and civil society involved. To see the power of inclusive economic development and business bringing real benefits to real people. BFP: What have been your greatest challenges? RO: In developing and advising on inclusive business implementation there are many challenges. Actors need a shift in mindset to invest in a joint vision for win-win situations. This move towards being more inclusive is not happening only in the development sector, but is part of a bigger and growing trend in business to focus on shared value and on longer-term sustainability, as argued by Kramer &amp; Porter (Shared Value). Some of the main challenges for inclusive business and development are: For companies: to get a better picture of how inclusive business models will enhance their business value proposition and improve corporate sustainability; but they need to invest into the BOP and think longer term. Another challenge for companies is to get access to shared risk capital and patient capital. For communities: to establish a culture of becoming reliable business partners, and to move away from dependency. For the government: to embrace an inclusive business philosophy and framework, and work on improving the enabling environment seriously &#8211; there are still many obstacles for developing and doing inclusive business, including regulatory obstacles, red tape and bureaucracy causing high transaction costs, and poor governance and corruption, all of which make it difficult to do any kind of business. For NGOs: to critically question their own interventions and programmes, as well as those from donors and other practitioners; and to get actual results. Based on that to share what works and what doesn’t BFP: How have you overcome these challenges? What is the secret of your success? RO: Firstly SNV works with local actors, with locally-determined agendas and with multiple stakeholders. So we play an important trust building and brokering role. Actors need to learn to speak each other’s language and to build relationships.We are investing in the capacities of those local actors and business needs to do that seriously as well. Secondly you need to build on what works, learn from different models, promote south-south learning and have well-developed and tested models, which should be applied not as a blueprint but flexibly in new contexts and environments. We favour that successful inclusive business experiences get replicated rather than re-inventing the wheel each time. SNV has published lessons and models from our work in Latin America with WBCSD (Creating value in Latin America) and are in the process of finalizing an inventory of case studies in Zimbabwe and Mozambique with the Ford Foundation. We are involved in a growing number of interesting inclusive business cases in Africa, for example the PepsiCo chickpea project in Ethiopia, Dairy development in Kenya, commodity companies in Mozambique and agricultural supply chain involving seed companies, wholesalers and rural retailers in Zimbabwe (Agriseeds). Some of the lessons we have learnt include the following: Listen first to all actors, look at opportunities and learn from other experiences. Get the business case right – otherwise there is no inclusive business to build on. For inclusive business models to succeed, top management commitment is necessary. NGOs should see themselves as independent facilitators aiming at win-win for all actors, not taking sides. Build broader partnerships of multiple stakeholders, from single firm entry to multiple firms in the whole subsector to get to scale and to overcome systemic bottlenecks in the value chain. This includes the donor community and other practitioners. Have motivated people with the right attitude, to establish results. Success will lay the foundation for upscaling and that is self-motivating. As managers we have to steer and motivate people to achieve their own success. That is also the secret of advisory work: we don’t tell the actors what to do, but build with them the capacity to do it themselves. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do, where should they start? RO: The ever more globalized world around us is changing, and so are the investment patterns and the way of doing business. This offers a lot of scope for young dynamic people to bring the business and development spheres together, the interface of sustainability offers a good start either with a company or with an NGO. For sure traditional careers in development organisations are a thing of the past. BFP: Finally: what do you hope to get out of being part of the BFP community? RO: BFP creates the opportunity to learn from experiences of other practitioners, to promote inclusive business development and to contribute to the successful upscaling of the best models. AS SNV we are interested and looking to establish partnerships with donors, foundations and corporates for upscaling of things that work, as well as promote cross country and cross regional learning.

20888,Ruth Brännvall,https://businessfightspoverty.org/ruth-brannvall,"BFP: What do you do? RB: I run Njord Consulting, we support every type of organisation to implement Social Responsibility across operations. Developing their strategy and business models, and giving advice on how to make it work in practice. We specialise in marketing strategies and social investments for emerging and developing countries. I&#8217;m also a partner of a few other companies where we work on social innovation and sustainability. I am a typical strategist &#8211; I love intellectual challenges and how to make a good idea successful! BFP: What is the best part about your job/project? RB: We are involved in the challenge fund Innovations Against Poverty, where it is fantastic to meet and support some very innovative entrepreneurs. I also work with established corporates, helping them implement social responsibility. No day is like the other; one day I may work with a start-up on how to make a business model more robust, the next day I advise a corporate on how they could use their existing technologies for a developing market. BFP: What has been your greatest challenge? RB: To meet more companies with great assets and resources willing to be directed to segments and under served markets which could make good use of them. Many companies are very risk averse and still too short term focused, and therefore stick to the same segments as their competitors. BFP: How have you overcome these challenges? RB: It is a massive challenge still! But nowadays we preach to those who have their ears open and do not waste time with companies that do not have the appetite for change. We have noticed that family and privately owned businesses and are more receptive to take their social responsibility further. The trend of social entrepreneurship I think will also help to showcase opportunities that larger businesses are hesitant to do. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do, where do they start? RB: First, ask yourself which problem you could help solve, what are the skills, resources and personality you bring. Second, connect with different key people as much as you can to figure out what your niche and proposition can be. And third, get going as soon as possible. As an entrepreneur be focused on the problem you are trying to help solve and get going to try out your hypothesis, rework, try again. Be sure to continuously develop your experience and expertise &#8211; across disciplines if you wish to work with creative processes. BFP: What do you hope to get out of being part of this community? RB: For me it is a great way of connecting with people that I would not otherwise have access to and to get new ideas and input. I hope also to contribute with things that may be equally valuable to other people. Editor&#8217;s Note: Thank you to Ruth Brännvall for taking the time to do this interview.

20891,Catherine Dolan,https://businessfightspoverty.org/catherine-dolan,"BFP: What do you do? CD: I lecture at the University of Oxford’s Said Business School in the Marketing, Culture and Society Programme. This programme provides a different angle to understanding markets and marketing, focusing on how the nature of society, cultural norms and meanings, and historical changes influence how and to what extent people participate in markets. Within the programme, I teach MBAs on the role culture plays in markets and marketing in courses that focus on CSR, base of the pyramid schemes, social innovation, cause-related marketing and so on. BFP: What is the best part about your job? CD: The best part about my job is definitely doing field research and the opportunity it provides to get to know people who are considered the beneficiaries of the development/business initiatives I study, particularly women. It is very rewarding to listen to women talk about their lives &#8212; their source of happiness, the challenges and constraints they face, their aspirations. These conversations provide a window into how specific development or market-based interventions are impacting their lives, what their consequences are on the ground, and whether or not they are likely to produce the benefits they aspire to such as economic empowerment or education. When you understand culture &#8212; the role of social expectations, gender norms, religion etc. – you are much better placed to design an innovation that will take hold, whether it is a mosquito net, mobile phone platform or irrigation system. While I’ve done most of my research in Africa, I’ve recently been involved in a project in Bangladesh: the CARE Bangladesh’s Rural Sales Programme (RSP), which aims to create employment opportunities for marginalized women and to improve the access of the rural poor to a range of consumer goods. It’s been very interesting to work on this system, and has really highlighted why initiatives thrive in certain socio-economic and cultural contexts and wither in others. Aside from research, I really enjoy the opportunities Oxford University provides me to interact with colleagues from diverse disciplinary backgrounds. In addition to being a Lecturer at Said Business School, I am also a Fellow of Green Templeton College. Oxford Colleges are much more eclectic than departments and as faculty give us the chance to engage with colleagues who have perspectives, backgrounds and disciplinary orientations completely different than our own. As an anthropologist, the opportunity to share my research with economists, geographers, medics, etc, has really nourished and expanded my own thinking. And, of course, there is no end to compelling seminars and conferences to attend. BFP: What has been your greatest challenge? CD: I sometimes feel caught in the crossfire of business and development. On one-hand you have a camp of management studies faculty and business and on the other side you have a camp of anthropologists, development studies scholars and practitioners, and NGOs. There is a real division between these two worlds and it operates at multiple levels despite a rhetoric and discourse of public private partnerships, sustainable enterprise, CSR, and so forth (not withstanding the real examples of effective partnerships). Really, despite the growing public recognition of business’ role in creating a sustainable and just society, there is still a legacy of distrust and resistance on both sides. In fact, despite the catastrophic effects of of the global financial crisis, management studies has been slow to respond, and in my experience, is reluctant to acknowledge that the tools of anthropology, philosophy or sociology and so on (rather than purely economics) might offer some answers. At the same time, anthropologists and NGOs often view business as the devil incarnate, whose greedy and corrupt practices are the cause rather than the solution to development problems. As an independent scholar, located in a business school with a background in anthropology and development it can be a challenge to straddle these two worlds and gain the trust from both sides. I also think that the continued mistrust between corporates and NGOs and the defensiveness on both sides can make it difficult to respond to the difficulties that market-based interventions inevitably face. There is a tendency to broad brush them, either celebrating or lambasting them, rather than identifying those aspects that are successful and those that are not. It can also be difficult to address problems and identify how we might more successfully implement certain initiatives, without “throwing the baby out with the bath water”. For example, when labour violations are found in an ‘ethical supply chain’ how we can accept that as part of the process of transforming supply chains instead of dismissing it as evidence of corporate greenwashing. Or when Fairtrade isn’t working how we can improve it so it can better serve its intended beneficiaries. Our upcoming Base of the Pyramid Debate aims to address how we can start these difficult conversations. BFP: What advice can you give others facing a similar challenge? CD: One of things I would recommend is to be frank, by that I mean be honest about the strengths and weaknesses of a project, but convey them in a language that is sensitive to the position of the organisation/ person you’re speaking to. Continuing to talk about legitimate concerns, rather than just sweeping them under the carpet is a way forward. I think it is very important to air the problems and address the frictions rather than just using the language of “win- win”, “partnerships” and “collaborations” that gloss over the tensions and just shore up the positions of different sides. For example, while management scholars largely praise bottom of the pyramid schemes, they are often dismissed, if not vilified, in development circles. So what happens is that business looks to the evidence of management scholars to celebrate its initiatives and NGOs find support for their views from development studies faculty. Again when we avoid publishing what business, or alternatively development, would find unpalatable, and just present one-sided accounts of success or failure, we actually increase the gap between business and the social sciences. In truth, these things are never black and white and I’d love to see a change in this area&#8212; more acknowledgement of the complexity of these programmes and grater patience in addressing their weaknesses. We refer to these issues briefly in a recent blog entitled “BoP approach: Sinner or Saviour” . BFP: If someone wants to do what you do – where do they start? CD: I haven’t taken a conventional route, with a clear channel. In theory you could do it one of two ways. You could study in the social sciences, gain experience in development or social enterprise and apply those lessons to the management curriculum. Alternatively, you could purse a degree in management studies, and work in business on social change issues. For example you could do a degree in management studies and focus your PhD on development area such as healthcare, poverty reduction, education, informality etc. BFP: What do you hope to get out of being part of this community? CD: One of things I really like about Business Fights Poverty is that it is an excellent locus for knowledge sharing. The site is a barometer of what’s happening in the practitioner world and provides me with examples of good practice that are really useful in my research and teaching. I use the site to take the pulse of what’s out there and what practitioners are engaged in. This is a world that I don’t have regular access to as an academic and I find the site is really helpful in developing new connections and potential collaborations. It was through Business Fights Poverty that I was first introduced to Colalife, for example, an enterprise I hope to engage with further.

20894,Steve Metcalfe,https://businessfightspoverty.org/steve-metcalfe,"BFP: What do you do? SM: I work for Youth Business International, a global network of non-profit initiatives which help young people to start their own business. We currently operate in 33 countries and last year helped nearly 8,000 young entrepreneurs, with a combined package of access to loan capital, training and mentoring. I’m responsible for YBI’s communications work – helping to raise the profile of the work that we do around the world. This includes the YBI Entrepreneur of the Year competition which shows the impact that successful entrepreneurs can have on their local communities. I also am responsible for Global Entrepreneurship Week in the UK. Global Entrepreneurship Week is a campaign that runs in over 120 countries (YBI’s members host it in 9) – to promote entrepreneurship. BFP: What is the best part about your job? SM: I enjoy the international nature of my work, working with colleagues from very different countries and cultures who all agree on the same thing – the importance of helping aspiring young entrepreneurs. It&#8217;s probably the individual success stories that are the most inspiring though, and certainly getting our 2011 Entrepreneur of the Year, Amir Asor from Israel, onto the business TV channel CNBC last year to show off his business to millions of people was certainly very rewarding. BFP: What has been your greatest challenge? SM: The challenges of building a network, and getting not just agreement but buy-in from around the world should not be underestimated! It takes a lot of hard work and effort to really develop projects collaboratively. Just because a project makes sense for one organization, that doesn’t mean that it would automatically work for other organizations in our network. Sometimes this means that things take longer than they might in a more traditional structure but on the flipside, when you get things right, the impact can be huge. BFP: What advice can you give others facing a similar challenge? SM:Consultation is key, as it giving plenty of time to plan projects. I think also keeping things simple is important too. Its very easy for things to get complicated very quickly, but if you want the maximum amount of people to engage with you and understand what you’re driving at, then you’ve got to keep things simple. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do – where do they start? SM:Well, I’m not sure how traditional my journey was as I started off my career as a business journalist, and then moved into CSR and communications at the International Business Leaders Forum before moving to Youth Business International. Probably the consistent element through that has been my interest in ‘stories’ – being a business journalist taught me how to work out what was interesting from a communications perspective, as well as of course how to write and present. And of course it gave me a love of deadlines, which I like to think keeps me on track and helps to juggle competing priorities! BFP: What do you hope to get out of being part of this community? SM: I like the diversity of Business Fights Poverty – there is a huge range of people in the network, professional with quite different jobs and at different levels, but all with a shared belief in the role that business can play in development. I think its great to be part of such a positive, forward-thinking community. Editor&#8217;s Note: Thank you to Steve Metcalfe for taking the time to do this interview.

20897,Chris Markl,https://businessfightspoverty.org/chris-markl,"BFP:What do you do? CM: I&#8217;m the Founder of Kourage Athletics: Kenya&#8217;s Running Brand &#8211; We create athletic apparel that is 100% African &amp; 100% Ethical from design through distribution. Our garments are sold globally with revenues reinvested into Kenya. We seek to leverage the storied tradition of Kenyan runners to inject foreign revenue &amp; investment into Africa to create jobs. I also work as an Associate Professor of Economics Florida State College at Jacksonville and a freelance economic consultant. BFP: What is the best part about your job? CM: That I work with brilliant Kenyan entrepreneurs who are my good friends. Hussein my partner in Kourage &#8211; is one of my best friends in the world. I&#8217;m obsessed with his work. Also its pretty cool to get calls and text with World Champion athletes. BFP: What has been your greatest challenge? CM: Separating ourselves from the social entrepreneur crowd and attracting capital. There is a great rise in social entrepreneurship &#8211; which is fantastic &#8211; but it makes it easy for the nuances of Kourage to get lost. Some of the things I&#8217;m most proud about in our brand are things that go unnoticed. We always want to push to become more and more Kenyan/African. We don&#8217;t want to employ the Branding of Kenya/Africa, but we think creatively to centre as many operations of Kourage in this location. Second I love that Kourage isn&#8217;t creating a caricature of Kenya/Africa. I think many organisations showcase poverty while trying to do good &#8211; instead our message is &#8220;I&#8217;m Kenyan and I am going to leave you standing in this race&#8221;. We are leveraging athletic dominance &#8211; to transform what the world thinks of Africa. This is our ethos &#8211; this is why we are called Kourage. I think we best describe what we stand for in an organization in this short video: BFP: What advice can you give others facing a similar challenge? CM: Patience. Patience and hard work. We constantly experiment and fail but we learn. As long as we don&#8217;t give up Kenya will be the running apparel capital of the world. This is the advice I would provide: Always ask the question: Why? Why is it done this way? Why couldn&#8217;t it be done in a different way? How can we turn this paradigm upside down? BFP: If someone wants to do what you do – where do they start? CM: Set aside 10,000 hours and get excited. BFP: Finally, what do you hope to get out of being part of this community? CM: I want to learn from like-minded individuals who are interested in finding unique ways that for-profit businesses can improve lives throughout the globe.

20900,Chris Brett,https://businessfightspoverty.org/chris-brett,"BFP: What do you do? CB: I am the Global Head of Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability for Olam International, a leading agricultural supply chain management company. We manage supply chains for 21 agricultural products in 65 countries, from producers through processors to final customers, many of whom are very well-known global brands. We’ve expanded heavily into our own agricultural production and processing, and a lot of this takes place in emerging markets. We also process, package and sell our own branded food products into African markets. My job is to ensure that we comply with international standards; ensure sustainability in the supply chains we manage and support the communities where we operate; understand our impact on the environment and manage any environmental concerns. More information about Olam’s Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability (CRS) strategy is available here. You can read our latest CRS report here and our Livelihood Charter is available here. BFP: What is the best part about your job? CB: Being able to involve communities, and linking farmers to global supply chains. Olam now works with more than 1.5 million farmers across Africa, Asia and Latin America. We would often start with setting up a processing unit and then linking this with farmers on one side and the global market on the other. We establish farmer-based partnerships with the objective of increasing their direct incomes through training programmes, pre-finance and the supply of inputs. It is very rewarding to be able to connect small-scale producers to their global customers in this way. BFP: What have been your greatest challenges? How have you overcome them &#8211; what is the secret of your success? CB: The most important challenge we have had has been stakeholder management. In particular, working with very large numbers of individual producers can be very challenging. In order to efficiently deliver the training and other support we provide to producers in or agricultural supply chains, we need to bring farmers together into cohesive groups – not always an easy process. The start-up phase of entering a new country and setting up a new business is always the most challenging. We have overcome this obstacle by working with NGOs as delivery partners. We recognize where our core strengths lie and we draw on our partners to supplement this. We have been fortunate in that we’ve received donor support for several of our projects, which means that there is funding available to pay an NGO to be our implementing partner. Today Olam is widely recognized as a private sector development partner, who can bring our skills in investment, setting up processing units and developing integrated supply chains into partnerships with donors and delivery partners that can improve the lives of thousands of people. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do, where should they start? CB: Personally, I have had a very varied background which spans both the private and public sectors and many different regions. I started out by accepting a 2-year volunteering position in 1983 with VSO in Nigeria teaching agriculture and literacy in a rural vocational training centre. When that completed I immediately started working for an agro-industrial company based in Nigeria that had a regional remit, so I frequently visited Ghana, Cote d’Ivoire, Cameroon and other surrounding countries. Eventually I decided to leave in 1993 and returned to the UK to complete a Management for Agricultural Development Master’s degree in Cranfield University. Following that I then spent several years working for DFID as a private sector development adviser in Latin America, before becoming a consultant to both the public and private sectors. I then joined Olam in 2007 and this allows me to bring all this experience together. I have noticed a growing trend for the private sector to recruit from the public and NGO sectors as this brings a different skill set that is required by the private sector as there an increasing requirement for companies to be directly involved in the development agenda. These days there are lots of opportunities with companies for people with these skills. But it is important to be sure that you want to work in development: I believe working in development is a lifestyle choice, which will impact on your life in many different ways. I think volunteering in a developing country provides a great opportunity to understanding what this kind of work is about and to work out whether it suits you. Volunteering doesn’t have to be only with NGOs or charities – companies increasingly offer volunteering and internship opportunities. Olam is constantly on the lookout for experts with experience of working in emerging markets. We encourage potential applicants to look at our website and submit a CV and covering letter directly to our HR department. BFP: Finally: what do you hope to get out of being part of the BFP community? CB: I appreciate the diversity of people who belong to the network. I have a great interest in using technology and new ideas to grow business in emerging markets, and BFP is a good source of information on those big new ideas. It also allows me to understand and stay on top of the donor agenda. BFP events provide an opportunity to meet and talk to NGOs who could become future partners – it is a very useful platform for efficient networking. It has also been a great source of potential employees – we get many approaches from interesting students, often African nationals doing post-graduate courses at UK universities, who are very familiar with Olam’s work in Africa and who might end up working for us as part of our ongoing drive to build local expertise in-country. BFP could be further enhanced by more knowledge zones on particular topics (such as agribusiness). Members could then upload interesting articles there or debate new ideas. I would just caution against allowing individuals to use the network as a platform for self-promotion – in the past BFP have been very good at minimizing PR-type interaction, and it is important to keep this up.

20903,Joyce DeMucci,https://businessfightspoverty.org/joyce-demucci,"BFP: What do you do? JD: I am the Global Marketing and Product Development Manager for Barefoot Power. Barefoot Power is a global, social for-profit enterprise that manufactures and distributes solar phone charging, lighting products and business development services to people at the base of the global economic pyramid. Barefoot Power is on a mission, to bring affordable renewable energy and efficient lighting to 5 million people by 2012 and 10 million people by 2015, and help eradicate energy poverty. By bringing electricity to millions of people that currently use kerosene lighting and walk far for phone and battery charging, we plan on reversing the traditional process of rural electrification while reducing the global carbon footprint. Barefoot distributes its products in 20 countries around the world. Our main focus is on Africa, but we are also active in the Americas and Asia Pacific. We have subsidiaries in Uganda and Kenya and importers in several other African countries. On the ground, BFP has more than 200 sales points throughout Africa. We use a combination of micro franchise, retail, non-government organization and micro finance partnerships, and corporate programs with telecommunication companies and corporate social responsibility programs. I have been based in Uganda for the past 2.5 years, initially to help set up Barefoot Power’s subsidiary and expand local distribution channels. Currently, I am a member of the Senior Management team and accountable for Global Marketing and building awareness to help scale the business and transfer our business model into a number of other African countries. Additionally, I am accountable for Product Development and maintaining high quality standards in product design, development and production and institutionalizing a product development process. BFP: What is the best part about your job? JD: The best part for me is being able to be closely connected to the communities we seek to impact with our products. After 20 years in a corporate environment in the United States, working mainly for high-tech and consumer goods companies, both start-ups and large multinationals, I decided that I didn’t want to work in an office or corporate setting anymore and moved to Africa. I love working for a for-profit social enterprise and being based out in the field. Walking into a village and meeting a 70-year old man beaming with pride because he has access to safe, clean, affordable light and seeing how this has improved his quality of life, is very rewarding. BFP: What have been your greatest challenges? How have you overcome them? JD: When we first came to Uganda and started building relationships with stakeholders, many tended to see us as an NGO or not-for-profit organisation. We would recruit people to be trained as micro-franchisees and find that they expected us to pay for the training. This was understandable, given their past experience of working with NGOs who had funding and were giving things away. We addresses this head-on by making the case for paying for training, explaining the business model and demonstrating how this investment would pay for itself. People absolutely got it and came on board. Some of the entrepreneurs that worked with us are now landowners and small business owners who employ people in their own right, confirming that the impact of Barefoot’s products go far beyond delivering safe, clean and affordable power. Another major challenge in our business is the complex set of duties, taxes and government subsidies that apply in the area of solar power. Each country has its own rules and regulations and in some countries high duties make it difficult for us to make our business model work. We have addressed this issue by joining Lighting Africa, a joint IFC and World Bank program that helps develop commercial off-grid lighting markets in Sub-Saharan Africa as part of the World Bank Group’s wider efforts to improve access to energy. Lighting Africa pulls together all the relevant stakeholders in an open forum and we are working through this platform to reduce regulatory barriers to increasing access to affordable solar-powered products. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do, where should they start? JD: My advice to a young professional starting out would be to focus on what you like to do, what you love, what you would look forward to doing when you get up in the morning – chances are you will be good at it! Don’t let fear get in the way of pursuing what you really want – it is so easy to get caught up in a job that you know you can do and which pays well, but which might not be what really excites you. Especially in the developed world, I think we get trapped in jobs that pay well but that don’t necessarily fulfill us on a deeper level. BFP: Finally: what do you hope to get out of being part of the BFP community? JD: I got involved in Business Fights Poverty for professional reasons – I am not naturally a big social networker so joining a network of peers was a very useful way for me to stay in touch with others in our industry and sector. I find the regular summaries and updates on major developments and trends very useful. It is important for people to feel that they are part of a community and Business Fights Poverty offers such a community of like-minded people. I wonder if there is a way to build on that community through the creation of a user forum where people can interact on a particular topic of interest – for example a presentation highlighting a member contribution followed by a discussion on a conference call for those that are interested in learning or sharing more. It could be like a virtual cocktail party where no-one needs to feel intimidated about not knowing anyone! Editor&#8217;s Note: Thank you to Joyce DeMucci for taking the time to do this interview.

20906,Jane Muthee,https://businessfightspoverty.org/jane-muthee,"BFP: What do you do? JM: Through the Elyon Trust, I am promoting sustainable economic growth and financial autonomy among young entrepreneurs and women in rural and urban settlements by identifying, designing and developing strategies which they can use to establish and run profitable income generating activities in their day to day lives. We support these people in order to lift themselves out of abject poverty through micro lending, capacity building and value chains in agri-business and micro enterprise. Elyon focuses on the poor youth and women, mainly in the rural areas who otherwise have no access to finance and banking services at all. The Trust brings together people of different cultures, religions, women and youth without prejudice. Our target group is the very poor who live on less than a dollar per day, whose saving capacity is very low. Through mobilising their small savings, these people are able to borrow small loans that transform their lives. From humble beginnings, Elyon has grown rapidly to our current membership of 500 groups of 20-40 people per group. The current loan portfolio has grown to Ksh20 million and with savings of over Ksh5 million. We focus on the rural areas of Central, Lower Rift Valley and Eastern Kenya Regions, and also still operate within the urban slums of Nairobi, particularly Eastlands. BFP: What is the best part about your job? JM: The best and most fulfilling part of my job is when I walk with poor women and young people from poverty to self reliance in their daily lives, to a point where they are able to shelter, clothe, feed and educate themselves and their children; and to watch their livelihoods change from misery to joy as we keep up our routine visits &#8211; they are all song and dance when we arrive at the village, glorifying God of heaven. I and my team of trainers enjoy the training sessions which only end because darkness is settling in, and interacting with these women who are always enthusiastic and ready to see their livelihoods improve for the better through hard work. I love the knowledge and skills they acquire, helping them and giving them the pride of life. I love it when I connect communities in one project which joins them together and makes them into one loving and caring family where they are each other’s keeper in all their activities; when they understand the principle of Business fighting poverty and not handouts/alms. BFP: What has been your greatest challenge? JM: This presents itself in unpredictable faces &#8211; we come across all kinds of people, including those who are after taking advantage of others, and those who come with hidden agendas. We have those who are sent by adversaries, politics of all kinds, and of course those are not willing to repay their loans and want to take advantage. Another challenge is maintaining completed value chains during high season when a particular crop is in high demand, reducing supply of that crop threatening the whole market chain. There are of course great success stories that keep us going, and the togetherness of the majority of the members who do not want anything to draw their economic gains backwards, helps us overcome these handles. We are a team, a family and people without prejudice, of religion, tribe or status. Our members are quick to report and follow after debts, and therefore our debt recovery is up to 98 – 99% paid up. To give just two examples: Mrs Mwangi is a peasant farmer in Ngatho on the outskirts of Ukambani, in the arid part of Lower Eastern Region. Elyon Trust provided her with a drip irrigation kit and she started by planting kale. She is now able to feed her family and sell to the surrounding villages, which has enabled her to pay high school fees for her older children. This project uses water harvesting and is 100% organic and leaves the environment clean. Another member, Ruth Member worked as a volunteer in a hospital but fell ill and needed an urgent operation. Her husband, a victim of substance abuse, could not help her. Ruth approached Elyon who paid for her operation. She then saved for 3 months and took her first loan to start a chicken business. She is today the proud owner of over 600 chickens and produces over 100 trays of eggs every week. She has built a house for the family and they are now living comfortably. We have of course made our mistakes but we have learnt from them and we are careful not to repeat the mistakes anymore, we are not overcome, as we have come to realize that mistakes and experiences are a school of improvement to the next level. Value addition business at the BOP is still very new, especially in the Horn of Africa. We have not seen many other models that we can learn from in this part of the country. Inclusiveness is a new and fast-evolving field and we are aware we have to be nimble. Access to partnership/grants and funding is also a major challenge especially in the area of safety nets programs and in particular health, disasters and benevolent in the family set ups. We need to leverage on our current and upcoming synergies in order to keep abreast. BFP: How have you overcome your challenges? What has been the secret of your success? JM: We have realized that a positive approach, concerted efforts with our management team, learning from past mistakes and allowing advancement of technology, innovation and understanding works well in addressing any setbacks. Learning from the wealth of knowledge of our members and allowing ideas and innovation also go a long way in improving the projects. Also, we believe in encouraging exchange programs with other like-minded partners; seeking knowledge and skills on entrepreneurship from others; and continuous research on what we strategize in our short, medium and long term goals and objectives. It is important to remain open to ideas, as we believe entrepreneurs do not put up a 200-page strategic plan and implement it on the spot, therefore we are always experimenting and adapting based on what we learn or experience along the way. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do, where should they start? JM: a) One must have passion to do something about the less fortunate b) Map out your goals and objectives c) Invest in the life of these people by being in constant interaction; work with them to get to understand what, who, where, how about them d) Invest financially and give yourself time e) Build their capacity, therefore you must be well in capacity at the BOP f) Set up shop, lay strategy for the immediate, mid term and long term, g) Identify your target h) Seek like minded partnerships BFP: Finally: what do you hope to get out of being part of this community? JM: I hope to make new acquaintances, connections, alliances and partnerships that will take us to the next level, and share experiences/ innovations/ ideas etc. I wish to learn what others of like minds have achieved in fighting poverty through entrepreneurship/small enterprise &#8211; their challenges, successes etc. What are their approaches that are different that they have used to improve their inclusive business models? It is also my prayer that this forum will change the concept of fighting poverty, ignorance and disease. I hope to see food security for the third world being reality not just words. I wish to come to a time when no one will die of hunger, lack, want and need. I want to see a time when all humanity shall be adequately fed, clothed, sheltered and have a decent education without much struggle. I hope for child and maternal health addressed locally without looking to donor funding, access to clean water, alternative fuel/energy to the rural… the list may be endless, I mention just a few!!

20909,Andy Wales,https://businessfightspoverty.org/andy-wales,"BFP: What do you do? AW: I am the Group Head of Sustainable Development at SABMiller. My job is to help SABMiller understand the socio-economic and environmental issues they face as a business, and to identify the business risks associated with these issues as well as the opportunities they create. I work with partners both inside our business and with other organisations such as donors, NGOs and governments, to find the best ways to utilise these opportunities or address the challenges (there&#8217;s more on our work here). In practice, this involves setting up partnerships on key sustainable development issues, for example partnering with the WWF and GIZ, part of the German government’s development agency, on our Water Futures programme which aims to address water scarcity; working with local smallholder farmers in countries like Tanzania and Zambia on supporting inclusive supply chains; and engaging with a wide range of stakeholders to help reduce the impacts of HIV/AIDS on our employees and their communities; BFP: What is the best part about your job? AW: Being able to connect senior business leaders in our Group with the most material social and environmental issues that matter to their business – in other words, engaging on a level that goes beyond philanthropic CSR. Not that CSR is not important – of course it has a valuable role to play – but I also need to show why these issues matter to the core business. I enjoy making that case. BFP: What has been your greatest challenge? AW: We have come a long way as businesses, governments, NGOs and donors in understanding how we can all work together towards common goals – but there is still much more to do. Many obstacles remain, due to the different agendas, different approaches, different languages and different timelines used by all these actors. I believe we’ve only scratched the surface: there is still enormous potential for partnerships to make a difference and have a real impact. The challenge has been to create opportunities for more partnerships; and also to extend existing partnerships to cover more markets, or to include more partners. BFP: What has been the secret of your success? AW: For me the most important skill is to listen: to the managing director about his most challenging business issues; to the government official about his delivery commitments; to donors about their programme priorities; to NGOs about the needs of their communities. Only by listening very carefully to each of the stakeholders can you identify intersections in objectives. Second, interpret the messages to find out what each party actually expects to get out of the process. Third, present your recommendations in the right context for each of the stakeholders you are dealing with, in a language that they can relate to. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do, where should they start? AW: Personally I completed a Master’s course with the Forum for the Future, which was a very good route to this line of work. This course is particularly good for covering issues from both sides of the spectrum (business and non-business). Whether you start from a business background or an NGO/government/donor background, it would be a good idea to get some real experience in the other sector. This kind of “cross-cultural” experience is critical for getting multi-stakeholder partnerships off the ground. BFP: Finally: what do you hope to get out of being part of this community? AW: Business Fights Poverty has developed a tremendous reputation and is a very efficient gathering place of like-minded people. The influence and reach of the network was demonstrated to me by a surprising surge in sales of my recent book (www.bigresponsibilities.org) after it was featured and debated on BFP – the response was much more noticeable than after a similar feature ran in a major UK newspaper. There is clearly a lot of goodwill among the BFP community; the challenge is to optimise this goodwill and to provide maximum opportunities for members to interact around topics that are of interest to them. I think the knowledge hubs have great potential to create more opportunities to engage, but they seem to be slow in getting up and running.

20915,Darian Stibbe,https://businessfightspoverty.org/darian-stibbe,"BFP: What do you do? DS: I am the Director of the Partnering Initiative, at the International Business Leaders Forum (IBLF). IBLF is a forum of multinational companies focusing on critical sustainability, leadership and growth issues. IBLF works at the interface of business and society on the understanding that sustainable business requires sustainable societies and vice versa. IBLF believes that for business and societies to be successful, we must redefine the concept of growth – an essential element of our capitalist society – to be smart, inclusive and responsible. It should be smart growth, in other words as efficient as possible, using as few resources as possible. It must be inclusive to ensure that as companies grow and prosper so do the communities and societies in which they operate grow and prosper. And it should be responsible, companies should ensure that their products or business models are not doing harm and instead can be forces for good. By redefining growth in this way it is possible for economies to grow, and companies to prosper without reaching limitations &#8211; whether these are natural resource limitations or societal challenges due to inequalities in society or due to the lack of education and skills. IBLF’s work is essentially about the convergence of business and societal interests. IBLF was founded in 1991, we knew then that in order for this to happen business needed to work much more strongly and effectively with other sectors of society, with governments, the UN, NGOs. At a time when this was not a popular notion, IBLF very much pioneered the theory and practice of cross sector partnering, by going ahead and doing it. Succeeding sometimes, failing other times, but at all times learning from it, to really understand what it takes to make these forms of collaboration happen. In 2004, based on a lot of the understanding and knowledge that we had gained, whilst also realising there was a huge amount still to learn, we created The Partnering Initiative, a specialist unit which aims to drive effective cross sector collaboration globally. BFP: What is the best part about your job? DS: The work that we are doing has the potential of creating real innovation and sustainability. Any job that you do, that makes you feel you are part of a movement for positive change is hugely fulfilling. At its core what I do is help people achieve things they could never do alone – and that is exciting! BFP: What have been your greatest challenges? DS: The ultimate objective for the Partnering Initiative is for a much more collaborative society. So when development actors have a problem to solve, we would like them to think about a collaborative, all-of-society approach to the issue. The challenges that businesses face are the same that society face &#8211; around rule of law, education and health and extreme poverty. All of which can prevent businesses from being able to expand into new markets. Business needs to understand that if it is going to be able to grow in these markets it needs to be part of helping to build a society where business can be a success. There is awareness to be raised on all sides -that we can genuinely achieve the win-win solutions we always talk about. People have been talking about this for 20 years. Partnering in Rio, for example, became huge yet again, where everyone was talking about the failure of governments and the need for much better cooperation amongst other sectors. However this rhetoric has outpaced the actual implementation of these partnerships very, very significantly. BFP: How have you overcome these challenges and what advice, would you give to others? What is the secret of your success? DS: The Partnering Initiative (TPI) aims to make this rhetoric become a reality – to mainstream partnership. We believe that to achieve the necessary systemic shift, the issue must be addressed across four different levels: Individual: We need people who understand what partnering is about, who have the specific competencies and the skills set to be able to make the partnership happen and the mindset to be able to work effectively in partnership. This is a skill or competency set that is growing in importance and at some point will be just as mainstreamed as financial or IT skills in business, governments and NGOs. Organisational: In order for organisations to enter into business they need to be what we term “fit to partner”. They need to have in place the leadership and the mandate and the strategy around partnering. They need to have the incentives, systems and process for partnering in place and the skilled staff to be able to partner well. Partnership: Partnering across sectors is difficult. In most cases they take too long to set up, have too high transactions costs, run sub-optimally and are not achieving the significant potential they should, could and need it. So one of the things that TPI does is help partnerships form much quicker by helping to broker and facilitate the partnerships. And through health checks, evaluation and review, and trouble-shooting we help partnerships to remain effective. Societal: We need many, many more partnerships. What’s missing is a systematic approach to making that happen. This means creating the incentive, the awareness, the capacity and the opportunity globally and in-country for these partnerships to take place. If everyone understands what the benefits of partnering are, has the capacity to partner and the appropriate spaces made for dialogue and the partnerships are then supported, then there is a huge potential for scaling up the number of partnerships. TPI already works at all four of these levels and has learned a great deal from the experience. We are developing highly ambitious plans to achieve scale through a number of innovative approaches in partnership with others. The ultimate aim is to build a neural network of individuals and organisations who are able to support partnering at each of these four levels. We’ll be holding an event in London in October for organisations from all sectors where we’ll be thinking big – how to systematically embed collaboration across the world. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do, where should they start? DS: In terms of career path, my advice would be whichever sector you work in, find opportunities to work with or in other sectors. If you work in a business, then perhaps consider some kind of volunteering in a charity or a secondment to a government agency, so you can understand how other sectors work and think. You’ll also need a number of soft skills such as relationship building and empathy- being able to understand people’s different perspectives. As well as being able to listen and a desire to embrace diversity. In terms of educational training, The Partnering Initiative runs a range of partnering courses including The Certificate in Partnering Practice, which gives people a strong introduction to the theory and practice cross-sector partnering. Our sister organisation, the Partnership Brokers Association, which came out of IBLF, runs more specialised courses, focussing on the skills a broker would use to help a partnership happen. We are also hoping to develop a postgraduate certificate in partnering, similar to the one we used to run with Cambridge University. BFP: Finally, what do you hope to get out of being part of the BFP community? DS: It’s just brilliant to be part of a community of likeminded, interested and intelligent people who genuinely want to make a difference. The topic that we’re dealing with is complex and difficult. To have a community with which to share and to learn makes an enormous difference. Editor&#8217;s Note: TPI is planning an event in October “Turning the rhetoric into reality: How to systematically drive effective cross-sector collaboration globally”. The event is for organisations from all sectors who believe in the power of collaboration and want to make it happen systematically. If you would like to join the event, please contact Francesca Rhodes and you will receive an invitation once the date is set. Thank you to Darian Stibbe for taking the time to do this interview.

20927,Keith MacIntosh,https://businessfightspoverty.org/keith-macintosh,"BFP: What do you do? KM: I run a brand strategy and insight consultancy called Nomadical. We try to help organisations understand the landscape within which they operate, and make the best choices in terms of where they go, what they do, what they make, and how they tell their stories. There’s a couple of areas of focus. One is international work – often helping multinationals operate across markets in ways that are flexible and sensitive to local conditions. For example, at the moment I’m working with a client to understand the market in the DRC, and make sure they’re building a portfolio that offers something of value for rural populations and ‘bottom of the pyramid’ segments, while building an inclusive distribution system and value chain. The second is around socially-engaged organisations (a vague definition, but I’d include NGOs, fair trade brands, and others with an aim to effect positive change). Without big budgets, they need total clarity on their aims and messages in order to get their story across. But they often view branding and marketing with suspicion. An example would be some brand positioning work with a fair-trade clothing business. Unless they can differentiate and create sustainable demand, it really doesn’t matter how equitable the sourcing is – because nothing’s being sold. I guess we try to help the ‘big guys’ be better, and the ‘good guys’ get bigger. BFP: What is the best part about your job? KM: From a personal point of view, I love the fact that my work forces me to learn – new categories, new countries, and new ideas. Part of that is about physically spending time in different places (most recently Kinshasa) in order to help clients really understand a place and its possibilities. But it’s not just about travel, it’s about being able to satisfy my curiosity about things I don’t currently understand. But satisfaction only really comes when I can help a client turn those insights into actions that make a difference in the real world. That means providing people with what they actually need, rather than creating artificial ‘wants’. It means better use of resources – so prices are lower and products are appropriate for the people who need them most. And it means people get products that provide a real boost to their physical and social wellbeing, rather than substandard and overpriced tat. BFP: What has been your greatest challenge? KM: I’m often working in local markets for international clients, and it can be hard to pick a path through the minefield of assumptions. People often make false comparisons, impose answers that come from elsewhere, and assume that because they’ve seen something succeed (or fail) somewhere else, it’ll be the same here too. But if we follow false assumptions, we fail to respect local people and do justice to their preferences. That’s not to say everywhere is entirely different – people often have more in common than I expect. But similarities have to be discovered through open-minded investigation, not imposed from a global HQ. BFP: How have you overcome these challenges? What has been the secret of your success? KM: There’s no substitute for empathy. Without it, it’s impossible to generate anything that makes sense from a branding or marketing perspective. So I always try to find processes that push clients to think about things as ‘normal’ people do. What would those people say? How would they feel? How do they really live? What would make life better? It’s important to build up that picture with fresh eyes, not just to colour it in based on what has been seen elsewhere. And that goes for me too – I have to always be prepared to ask the naïve question. It’s often easier for me to do it than for my clients, who have to think about their position and their politics. The goal can’t be just for me to look clever. It has to be for the team – collectively – to get the best understanding that we can. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do, where should they start? KM: I spent some time in market research and analysis, to begin with – it was a helpful way to get some methods and principles to put real people at the heart of things. But you could also come into it through advertising, design, or technical research – any of those should build up the key skills of analysis and communication, as well as the vital ‘human’ side. Because ultimately the rigour and analysis means nothing unless you can explain things, build trust, and guide people towards the right answer for them. BFP: What do you hope to get out of being part of the BFP community? KM: It’s an opportunity to be exposed to different ideas, approaches, or frameworks – all from people who hopefully share my view that business is not only a possible route to improving the world, it may even be the most effective. And hopefully there may be some chances to collaborate – with potential clients, partners or suppliers – and turn our collective good intentions into something that works.

20931,Susan Olsen,https://businessfightspoverty.org/susan-olsen,"BFP: What do you do? SO: I am a Lead Specialist in the Inter-American Development Bank’s Opportunities for the Majority (OMJ) Initiative. The aim of the OMJ is to provide financing, risk sharing facilities and technical assistance for private companies to develop and scale innovative business solutions that reach the base of the pyramid (BoP), with social impact. The IDB was the first international multilateral financial institution to create a dedicated unit and allocate funds specifically for private sector BoP market development. The OMJ was originally set up as a pilot within the IDB, with a budget of $250 million to develop a project portfolio, but our mandate was recently renewed with an indefinite time frame and resources. I play an advisory role at the OMJ, on the one hand engaging companies to convince them that there is good business to be done at the base of the pyramid in developing new business models to target the 75% of the population in the low income bracket that are currently vastly underserved in terms of access to quality goods and services, as well as income earning opportunities. This involves brainstorming to get fresh ideas and brining different parties together to facilitate “cross-fertilisation” between companies in various countries and sectors. On the other hand, for those companies that are already engaged in this space, we provide support in the implementation of their innovative business ideas, for example through providing finance or loan guarantees or another form of risk sharing. We acknowledge that there is a lack of information about markets and doing business at the BOP, which often results in bottlenecks to company implementation and/or creates hurdles to implementing or scaling up good ideas. As a result these financing projects are most often combined with technical assistance which is vital to “grease the wheels” of the new business prototype, whether through piloting new partnerships, performing market segmentation studies or training actors involved in the value chain or economic model. In keeping with the IDB’s broad regional scope we deal with companies active in Latin American and the Caribbean, and across a large range of sectors, including infrastructure, health, education, nutrition, housing, IT and financial services. We remain close to the projects that we finance or guarantee for the duration of that support, and then we also track the impact of those projects using existing impact indicators such as those measured through PULSE or the IRIS system, which has been adopted by the Global Impact Investing Network (GIIN). In a number of cases we would also do a full impact evaluation, especially for projects in the social sector, such as health or education. BFP: What is the best part about your job? SO: For me the best part is seeing companies change their mindsets, acknowledging that the top of the pyramid is basically saturated and that the base of the pyramid is where the opportunities lie. Once they realize this fact they take it as a core business project and put their best people onto it to do serious planning for a project launch – this is very exciting! It is very gratifying to work with companies that are seriously committed to making their business work at the BoP while optimizing their social impact. BFP: What has been your greatest challenge? SO: It’s the flip side of what I refer to in the previous question: to make this business with impact mindset happen! Too many companies still think of projects involving the BoP in terms of CSR, or “nice” things to do that look good in their company’s annual report. Many implement highly subsidized models that cannot survive on their own. But the needs in this sector are so great and the challenges so significant that we need sustainable core business models that can go to scale if we are to have any meaningful and lasting impact. BFP: How have you overcome these challenges? What is the secret of your success? SO: In my experience the most effective tool to challenge entrenched mindsets is to bring people along on field trips – where this is practical and possible of course. For example, in Argentina we were working on a project to develop a market for student loans; in this country there is no culture of banks making affordable loans available to students, so we plan to arrange for the group to travel to Mexico where the IDB recently financed a financial services project to make microloans available to students. With this corporate exchange methodology companies learn from each other, by the example of other businesses that have overcome the initial obstacles to developing a BoP model – and earned business success. In addition to bilateral field trips between countries in certain sectors we also facilitate cross-sectoral trips, where one industry can gain valuable insights from similar experiences in another. Where visits are not feasible, we arrange events where corporate business leaders are the speakers, again creating opportunities for them to share their credible experiences. BFP: If someone wants to work with you, where should they start? SO: Write us, visit, call&#8230; We want to build an industry of professionals dedicated to serving the Base of the Pyramid with sustainable business solutions, so more is better! More information on engaging with the MOJ is available at http://www.majoritymarkets.org/ and in this brochure, which also contains a number of project videos. BFP: What do you hope to get out of being part of this community? SO: As any development professional would say: you hope to see at least some people’s lives changed as a result of the projects that we structure and support. We won’t do away with poverty in my lifetime, but if each project can truly make a positive difference for as many beneficiaries as possible, that’s a good start.

20934,Andualem Sisay,https://businessfightspoverty.org/andualem-sisay,"BFP: What do you do? AS: I am a journalist and Social Media Promoter in Ethiopia. Currently I am Managing Editor and Founder of an Addis Ababa-based online newspaper, newbusinessethiopia.com, and I also give online citizen journalism training to Ethiopians passionate about journalism, through the New Business Ethiopia Journalism Institute. My project is making the online media the top Ethiopian independent news source in the world. BFP: What is the best part about your job? AS: The best part about the project is that there was a lack of daily news from Ethiopia by an independent, Ethiopian, private media source when I launched newbusinessethiopia.com in 2009. I promoted the idea of an online newspaper registered by the Ethiopian Broadcast Authority to conduct journalism ethically and professionally. The few private English language newspapers still update their websites only once in a week &#8211; after they sold their hardcopies. Now, people read about Ethiopia from Ethiopian registered media everyday. Today we are able to report about any issues within hours and many, both private as well as state media, often reprint our coverage on their media quoting us. BFP: What has been your greatest challenge (around business and development)? AS: The biggest challenge is the lack of awareness about online media by the local business community (potential product and service advertisers). Even after two years, finding a local company to run its commercials on our site is difficult. Local companies prefer running an ad on local papers which have 700 percent less audience than our news site. This has slowed the development of newbusinessethiopia.com because we are unable to recruit reporters in order enhance the quality and quantity of news coverage from Ethiopia. The other major challenge we faced for about a year was that some readers frequently tried to label us either to the opposition or ruling party side mainly because we allowed any kind of issue-focused comments on every story we publish. We understand that such attitudes have been developed from the past 20 years history of the Ethiopian private press and resisted the attitude by responding politely to their comments. Now, most of our readers have realised that true professional journalism stands in the middle and takes no side &#8211; as we are trying to do at http://newbusinessethiopia.com. BFP: How have you overcome these challenges? What are the secrets of your success? AS: The challenges are still with us. We are working hard to sustain the media by looking for potential advertisers from abroad and subsidizing it doing related research and linking Ethiopian companies with foreign investors. The secret so far is the passion I personally have to journalism as a profession and my way of living. Don’t take sides, communicate the reality on the ground professionally and never give up; even if practicing journalism in developing countries is like playing with fire. This is my advice to those who have passion for journalism and aspire to do what they like in their life time. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do, where should they start? AS: Like I did, the best thing before starting online media is to first create a blog and actively engage in social networks and learn about the political, economic and social affairs of the country we are reporting about, as well as understanding basic journalism principles and press law of the specific country. BFP: Finally: what do you hope to get out of being part of this community? AS: As a member of Business Fights Poverty, I would like to understand the issues raised by different members and make contacts, which will help me to achieve my dream of making http://newbusinessethiopia.com the top Ethiopian independent news source overcoming the challenges I mentioned above. I also look for funding from organizations or companies in order to graduate some 100 Ethiopian bloggers based in different parts of the country who are taking our citizen journalism training online at http://NBEInstitute.org Editor&#8217;s Note: Thank you to Andualem Sisay for taking the time to do this interview.

20937,Penny Fowler,https://businessfightspoverty.org/penny-fowler,"BFP: What do you do? PF: I lead Oxfam’s Private Sector advocacy team, which undertakes research, develops analysis and policy positions and lobbies companies and governments on issues relating to business and poverty. Oxfam’s overall aim is to maximise the contribution that business can make to poverty reduction through engaging with and working to influence companies’ policies and practices, and the regulatory environment within which business operates. Oxfam’s business engagement is structured around a number of agreed focus sectors and topics: agriculture, finance and climate change, including within the context of Oxfam’s Grow Campaign which aims to secure food justice in a resource constrained world. We work to engage companies in developing and implementing sustainable business models, and to share Oxfam’s insights from many years of experience working with partner organisations and local communities in over 70 countries around the world. We have developed a number of programmes in which we work collaboratively with business, for example, to support the development of small and medium-sized enterprises, with a specific focus on women entrepreneurs, and the promotion of inclusive business models. My team engages companies in advocacy dialogues on key issues identified in our policy analysis and programme work on the ground. Where necessary, Oxfam will challenge companies (and/or governments) to change their policies and practices, including through mobilising Oxfam supporters in public campaigning if we feel that this is the only or most effective way to achieve the necessary change. One recent example is the spotlight Oxfam has put on the new wave of land acquisitions which, due to inadequate global safeguards to protect the rights and needs of poor communities living on the land, can impact negatively on poor communities. BFP: What is the best part about your job? PF: Working with colleagues, partner organisations and businesses around the world who are committed to making a difference and changing the situation of people living in poverty. We face huge challenges in tackling global poverty but by working together, we can make a real difference to people’s lives. BFP: What has been your greatest challenge? PF: An ongoing challenge is convincing people that business and international development are not mutually exclusive objectives; whilst at the same time being quite clear that good intentions [on the part of business] are not enough. So one is constantly walking the line between recognising that business can make a positive difference and encouraging them to do more. There are clearly lots of win-win situations out there but it is not always obvious what the business motivation would be for getting involved in engaging in this space. BFP: How have you overcome these challenges? What has been the secret of your success? PF: I think it is often about being prepared to listen and appreciate different perspectives, and building relationships based on mutual respect. It helps to agree that there are substantial differences between parties’ views and expectations, but to then try to identify the common ground and to engage in constructive dialogue to increase understanding. It is important to recognise that everyone brings something to the table, that everyone has a contribution to make. By the same token, I think it is also important to recognise when you need to challenge people and confront them with difficult questions that don’t fit with their normal view or typical situation. Finally, NGOs including Oxfam need to be open to learning and increasing our understanding of what would enable business to do things differently. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do, where should they start? PF: Most importantly, you need to have a strong inherent desire and a commitment to work in this field. You can demonstrate this commitment by being prepared to spend time working overseas in a developing country, if necessary on a voluntary basis – this is a very competitive field and you need to demonstrate that you are serious about working in development and prepared to make a personal investment in getting the right opportunities. In my own case, I volunteered with Oxfam on completion of my Masters degree, and was then offered a two-year ODI fellowship in the South Pacific. On my return I did research, policy and advocacy work in the civil society sector for some time before joining Oxfam 12 years ago, where I’ve held a number of different positions prior to joining the private sector advocacy team. BFP: Finally, what do you hope to get out of being part of this community? PF: Business Fights Poverty is a great place to find information and contacts on a range of topics that I, personally, and Oxfam generally are interested in working on. It is useful for getting a sense of the big emerging ideas and the debates on issues that people are concerned about. Oxfam has used BFP to share Oxfam’s own work with this community and to let people know about new reports, analysis and campaigns; to advertise jobs with Oxfam; and to engage with the wider business and development community. We have also participated in several BFP events, including at CEO level. Editor&#8217;s Note: Thank you to Penny Fowler for taking the time to do this interview.

20940,Chris Jarvis,https://businessfightspoverty.org/chris-jarvis,"BFP: What do you do? CJ: Ha! This is one of the questions we’re asked on a regular basis &#8211; ‘what exactly does Realized Worth do?’ Admittedly, most people who ask this question are friends and family who don’t spend every waking moment thinking about Corporate Citizenship, CSR, Corporate Community Investments programs and Employee Volunteering. Even still, some faithful readers of our blog or even our online social community may be a bit fuzzy about our daily activities. So this is a great opportunity to paint a picture of the kind of work we do. The short answer is that Realized Worth works with companies to design and implement outstanding employee volunteer programs. But that breaks down into three basic types of activity. First, we talk. A lot. A big part of our routine is presentations. These take place in the form of workshops, keynoting at conferences, or as online webinars. Our topics vary, but we’re always talking about employee engagement in one of the following three areas: Social Media &#8211; A powerful tool for engaging employees (and other stakeholders) in a company’s CSR and corporate volunteering programs. Employee Volunteering &#8211; How to design, implement and optimize your program. Corporate Citizenship/Sustainability &#8211; Without strong employee buy-in, strategies never take off. Second, we work with clients. Our goal is to design and implement outstanding employee volunteer programs with a sustainable approach that enables the leadership and influence of the employees themselves. Typically our clients are large international corporations with existing employee volunteering programs that want to increase participation and impact. Third, we research and write. We conduct surveys, spend time talking to practitioners in the field and read (a lot). We use this research to write for books (HR for CSR), magazines (IABC Communication World), book reviews (Stanford) and help out with research projects such as Boston College’s Mapping Success in Employee Volunteering. We’ve recently contributed to CSR manuals being produced in Austria, Ukraine and Slovakia. Oh, and I forgot, we also blog (duh). BFP: What is the best part about your job? CJ: There are a myriad of reasons companies have employee volunteer programs. For example, volunteering is growing in popularity, volunteering is an effective means of engagement in the CSR strategy, volunteering communicates powerfully to the community. But whether or not companies realize it, there is one reason for employee volunteering and giving that stands above all the rest. The reason is this: it creates better people. Take a moment to consider the places where volunteering takes place. Usually it happens in the gaps left between what the systems of our society can do and what is needed: homelessness, hunger, poverty, sickness, etc. When we step into these spaces we go beyond what we know and have experienced. We volunteer to help, but when we decide to help someone else, something amazing happens: we remember our humanity. It doesn’t happen for everyone and when it does happen, it doesn’t look the same for everyone. But without question, the spaces of need we go to when we volunteer are rich with reminders of what really matters in life. Unfortunately, many of us spend our lives worried and anxious about health and wealth. We estimate our value based on what we drive, where we live, how much we make, and the degrees we’ve accumulated. These things are important, but they do not determine our value. Our humanity is not defined by what we own, how much money we make, or how much we can sell. These realizations tend to find us in a meaningful way when we step into the gaps and see the humanity that lives there – the humanity that is equal in value to you and me. We call these moments of realization epiphany. When it happens &#8211; you are changed forever. It is a transformative experience. This is the best part of my job. BFP: What has been your greatest challenge (around business and development)? CJ: The greatest challenge we have had in building our business is gaining a platform from which to speak about what we know is important. We have used social media to make connections, share good information, and add value to the conversation that has been happening on the topic of corporate volunteering. It has worked very well &#8211; but we’ve had to be very patient and let it happen. BFP: How have you overcome these challenges? What lessons have you learnt? CJ: I don’t think we have a secret for success. We leaned very heavily on what we knew we were good at and didn’t worry too much about all the rest. I would add that partnerships have been key. From the beginning we decided that we didn’t really have competitors. Rather, we had colleagues in the same field and we decided we wanted to help them with their success wherever possible. This collaborative approach has made all the difference in the world. We’ve been invited to join groups, attend conferences, introduced to decision makers &#8211; all because people know that we want them to succeed. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do, where should they start? CJ: This field is so new, the starting place is reading and listening &#8211; but get online and let your community curate the information for you. The CSR/Corporate Citizenship community is very generous and relatively small. I started by asking questions and making phone calls. Don’t worry about coming across like you’re not competent &#8211; people love to help and it’s a great way to build a solid network. Also, we started another business to pay the bills while we learned for 22 months. We didn’t take one client. We were asked, but we said no. This decision kept us from working on projects that were not our primary strength. It also enabled us to understand our business model (which changed once a month for those 22 months). BFP: Finally: what do you hope to get out of being part of this community? CJ: Business Fights Poverty has been instrumental in building our business in the following ways: Instant community – I’ve found great people from around the world and literally down the street who have helped us get where we are today on BFP. Good information &#8211; The knowledge shared on this site has been a staple in my learning journey. Awareness &#8211; With so much good info being passed around I’ve always felt on top of what was happening &#8211; in real time. Prioritizing &#8211; In the beginning it’s hard to know what is most important and where to start SEO &#8211; If you are writing a blog you need to be posting it on this site as well. Not only will it help you be seen and understood by the BFP community, the site itself helps you get found on Google. I cannot tell you how helpful the work BFP has been in our promotional work.

20943,Justin DeKoszmovszky,https://businessfightspoverty.org/justin-dekoszmovszky,"BFP: What do you do? JDK: Until July 2011, I lead SC Johnson’s Developing Markets sustainability initiatives, focused on Africa and sustainable business model adaptation and innovation to engage extremely low-income communities (ie: Base of the Pyramid, Inclusive Business, Creative Capitalism…). I originated and then managed a portfolio strategy that included supply-chain projects in Rwanda co-sponsored with USAID, urban sanitation micro-franchises in Kenya (Community Cleaning Services, CCS) and a partnership with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation focused on malaria. I am now leading sustainability action for SCJ Europe, but, given it has been only two months, will rely on my former position for this profile. BFP: What is the best part about your job? JDK: My best days are those when I can combine in-field and strategic work. For example, being in Mathare (one of Nairobi’s largest slums) working with the CCS team in the morning and then on a conference call with SC Johnson’s leadership developing our low-income consumer plans is fascinating and challenging. It is also an honor and pleasure to work in an organization that has such a powerful history of, and is so uniquely committed to, leading innovation in sustainable enterprise. BFP: What has been your greatest challenge (around business and development)? JDK: Operationally one of the great challenges was to translate between the languages of development and business and to create workplans that operate and deliver on both the development and business time-frames, especially when working in cross-sector partnerships. BFP: How have you overcome these challenges? What are the secrets of your success? JDK: First and foremost, I have been honoured to work with fantastic people and teams. From colleagues at SC Johnson to my teams in Kenya, Ghana and Rwanda and all our partners, I can’t give everyone I have worked with enough credit. Individually, in my experience, to be effective in the emerging and evolving intersection of development and business, interpersonal, organizational and cross-sector empathy is probably the most important instinct, skill and tool. Beyond that, it can only help to have language skills and living experience in emerging markets. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do, where should they start? JDK: In getting started and to accelerate my career, I found it necessary to take risks with a spirit of adventure. I was in a comfortable New York strategy consulting position when I wanted to shift my career towards business and development. This was in 2002 and few jobs were then being advertised; and those organizations doing interesting work in the sector were bombarded by queries but could not distinguish “serious” from “interested”. I quit my job and moved to Costa Rica to prove I was serious and talk my way, in person, into working with a conservation and eco-tourism organization. BFP: Finally: what do you hope to get out of being part of this community? JDK: BFP is valuable in that it allows me to learn from others, share challenges and identify opportunities. Like most great new things, though, I am sure I am under-utilizing it! As I transition into my new role focused on Europe, and less on emerging markets, I will use BFP to keep me connected and to help me continue guiding CCS as it is spun-out from SCJ as an independent social enterprise.

20946,Elizabeth Mleli,https://businessfightspoverty.org/liz-mleli,"BFP: What do you do? LM: I work for Deloitte Consulting Ltd in Tanzania as a Senior Consultant on the TUNAJALI project, a USAID-funded program focusing on People Living with HIV/AIDS (PLHIV) and Orphans and Vulnerable Children (OVC). The program focuses on the areas of providing care and support for PLHIVs and OVC as well as provision of institutional strengthening of Civil Society Organizations (CSOs). My role in this program is to provide institutional technical advice and support to the CSOs in areas of governance, leadership and management. BFP: What is the best part about your job? LM: My role gives me an opportunity to contribute to the strengthening of CSOs through organizational capacity building. It allows me to empower employees and organizations to acquire skills and competence for change management. There is great potential to bring positive change to CSOs here in Tanzania; this is very important if we want to see sustainable development, since civil society organizations provide services directly to the public and their communities. Sustainable development can be achieved through independent anchor organizations with the appropriate skills, revenue streams and capital assets and this is true for CSOs just as it is for private sector. BFP: What has been your greatest challenge (around business and development)? LM: There are several challenges with the building of institutional capacity of civil society organizations. The number one challenge is that most CSOs are used to running their own organizations informally, without any formal systems. Secondly CSOs are diverse, dynamic and complex, ranging from the smallest of community groups operating on a shoe-string; faith-based organizations driven by faith and sometimes not following the universal organizational systems; to larger non-governmental organizations with the potential for much bigger resources but sometimes lacking accountability. Thirdly, most development partners (i.e. funders) tend to put their focus on service delivery and very little on organizational strengthening, not recognizing that if we have stronger CSOs, then there will be a greater level of accountability and as a result a long lasting development impact. BFP: How have you overcome these challenges? What lessons have you learnt? LM: The secret to overcoming such challenges is to understand that institutional capacity strengthening is a process and not an overnight change. The best way to achieve this is through continuously improving civil society organizations’ systems, structures and leadership style, and promoting good governance through training and constant mentorship and coaching. The advice I would like to give to all development partners is that when they are implementing development programs they need to develop a balanced implementation framework in order to address all aspects of an organization and not to put their focus only on service delivery and quantity instead of also looking at impact and quality. The development approach needs to focus on CSOs’: Finances: CSOs need support and advice on funds &#8211; how they can source it, manage it; support in developing and navigating the funding networks, identifying the right kind of funding for different CSOs and developing a sustainable funding strategy. Sustainability: Sustainability starts with organization’s long term vision, mission and goals. It is the ability of a CSO to keep going through i) security of funding ii) its ability to recruit and retain volunteers and iii) properly to manage itself. CSOs need to be reminded of the importance of sustainability even after support from development partners have come to an end. Achieving the above will bring about sustainable development in communities that we work with. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do, where should they start? LM: Anybody can do capacity building but you need to have passion for it. If someone wants to do what I do, they need to start by familiarizing themselves with the area of work they want to build the capacity on. They might also need to receive training on training (Training of Trainers); develop their facilitation skills; train themselves on governance issues; organizational development; leadership; mentoring and coaching skills as well as shadowing someone who is already doing it. I believe that this is a good way to start and that is also how I did it. Before joining Deloitte Tanzania, I worked for Action in rural Sussex in the U.K. where I was the Co-ordinator for the East and West Sussex Voluntary and Statutory Sector ChangeUp Consortium. ChangeUp was the government initiative to build the capacity of Voluntary Sector across the UK. Before this, I worked for the Scarman Trust as Development Officer for the Children’s Fund Program. This work was about building organizational and technical capacity of community groups and frontline organizations. All my work experiences helped me gain many useful skills for providing technical support for both civil and private sector institutions. BFP: Finally: what do you hope to get out of being part of this community? LM: I am a relatively new member of BFP, but I find it to be a useful source of information, particularly on development issues. It will also be interesting to see what others are doing on public private sector partnership. I look forward to being more involved and also to attending some of BFP’s future events.

20949,Jim Thompson,https://businessfightspoverty.org/jim-thompson,"BFP: What do you do? JT: I work for the Global Partnership Initiative – or GPI – in the Office of the U.S. Secretary of State in Washington D.C. As the Deputy Special Representative for Global Partnerships, my job is to build public-private partnerships by creating connections when we see an opportunity for the government and the private sector to work together. I think of myself as a “yenta” – a matchmaker: I look at what our priorities and goals are at a given point, find out who is working in that space, and approach them to try to build a partnership. We currently have four flagship initiatives that we are managing for the Secretary of State: First, Partners for a New Beginning, which was established after President Obama called for a New Beginning with the Muslim world during his visit to Egypt two years ago. We work on the private sector aspect of this call for a new beginning, identifying companies active in those regions, especially those with corporate social responsibility programs that affect Muslim communities, and working with them to explore the scope for enhancing or expanding their programs – for example through making greater provision for the inclusion of women. Second, GPI pushed for and launched the Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves, a public-private initiative to combat indoor air pollution, while also saving lives, empowering women, and improving livelihoods through the promotion of clean cookstoves. We worked with agencies across the U.S. Government to convene the best partners to address this important issue, which has traditionally not been regarded as a top priority. In addition to the U.S. Department of State , the Alliance now includes the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the U.S. Department of Energy, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). These partners have jointly pledged more than $50 million over 5 years, and contributions from other private and public donors have pushed this total to over $80 million. Third, we manage the Secretary’s Global Diaspora Forum. The U.S. is home to over 60 million international migrants, out of a total population of around 300 million. These people make a huge contribution to supporting family and friends in their countries of origin: it is estimated that remittances are worth more than double the amount that flows to these countries in the form of foreign assistance. Yet we had no way of working with the Diaspora communities. The Global Diaspora Forum attempts to address this issue. This spring, we organised the first ever large-scale conference on the issue, which ran for three days in Washington D.C., and provided an excellent opportunity to share experiences and lessons learned from many successful Diaspora communities in the U.S., including Irish, Israeli, and Indian communities. We also launched the International Diaspora Engagement Alliance (IdEA), an innovative platform for public-private partnerships designed to engage Diaspora communities, the private sector, and public institutions in a collaborative process. The goal of IdEA is to support the development of Diaspora-centered partnerships that promote trade and investment, volunteerism, philanthropy, diplomacy, entrepreneurship, and innovation in countries of origin. And fourth, the 20II – Investing with Impact initiative brings the business community and civil society together to find ways to encourage more companies to “do good while doing well”, in pursuance of the “Shared Value” concept as promoted by Michael Porter and others. We are convening a major summit this fall, and plan to follow up with the launch of a number of impact investment hubs, the first of which will be in Brazil. Finally, I want to mention our work in the field of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) rights, a subject which Secretary Clinton has been such a strong advocate for throughout her period in office. We are planning a major summit in December, which will provide an opportunity to exchange success stories in addressing the rights of people in the LGBT community, particularly through the use of social media. BFP: What is the best part about your job? JT: I like having the chance to be a “jack of all trades” – I can talk about helping rebuild Haiti in the morning, about LGBT rights issues in Poland in the afternoon and about promoting the use of clean cookstoves in China in the evening – all within the course of one working day. I constantly have the opportunity to think and act outside of the government bureaucracy box. I am absolutely convinced that I have the best job in the entire State Department! BFP: What has been your greatest challenge (around business and development)? JT: One of our biggest ongoing challenges is to get others inside the government bureaucracy to change their views and to understand that their job is not what is used to be: that instead of just reporting, they need to be engaging – bringing others to the table and finding ways to work together. There is still a lot of culture change that needs to happen inside government; people need to accept that working in partnership means you need to trust your partners and let go of some of the control. In exchange, we can achieve so much more than we ever would have been able to working on our own. To give just two recent examples, last year’s second Democracy Video Challenge, a joint effort with NBC-Universal, YouTube and many others, gave thousands of filmmakers from around the world a chance to express their views on democracy to a global audience and sparked a lively debate in various social media forums. Similarly, through the MTV Exit campaign, we reached hundreds of millions of households with a powerful anti-trafficking message, which we never would have achieved working alone. BFP: How have you overcome these challenges? What lessons have you learnt? JT: For culture change to happen, you need top-level leadership to consistently talk about the need to change the way we do things and to ensure this message filters into every area of our work – including our offices abroad. So, it is important to also get our ambassadors engaged in this process. At the staff level, practical training in how to set up and manage partnerships is an essential part of making this change happen. Finally, in terms of working more closely with business – we tend to go for the low-hanging fruit, reaching out to companies that express an interest in working with us, rather than spending our limited time and resources on trying to convert the large number of corporates that are not yet on board with this message. There are enough companies out there who want to engage in these kinds of partnerships – who want to “do good while doing well” – to provide us with a strong range of potential partners for most of our projects; although admittedly this is more of a challenge in some areas, such as LGBT rights. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do, where should they start? JT: Personally, I am a career bureaucrat, with 20 years of experience working in government. Prior to this job, I worked for the Department of Energy as well as the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), where I was involved in the Global Development Alliance. During this time, I garnered knowledge and experience in grant-making and program management, and then learned about partnerships – all of this has been invaluable to me in my current position. These days, development is a tough field to break into. My advice to someone starting out is to try and find an intern position in an organization active in this space; to find out who is doing what, and to learn what it takes to “make it” in this field. Although I have not worked in the private sector myself, I do think it would be very valuable to spend time in a company in order to understand how businesses work, and in particular how corporate social responsibility is run and how it tends to relate to core business in the companies that do it well. BFP: Finally: what do you hope to get out of being part of this community? JT: I use Business Fights Poverty to make connections. It is a great mechanism for reaching out to people who are interested in this space. Through Business Fights Poverty, I have found both networking opportunities and potential partners for some of our projects. I am interested in exploring how we can work more closely with BFP, for example on arranging a conference to discuss HOW businesses are fighting poverty.

20953,Trevor Simumba,https://businessfightspoverty.org/trevor-simumba,"BFP: What do you do? TS: I am an international business consultant and Founding Director of the Tagos Group Zambia Limited and also founder of a success and wealth creation web portal, mind2wealth.com. I work independently with international development agencies and governments in Africa focused on policy research and analysis, international trade and investment reforms, regional integration and private sector development. I have worked in over 25 African countries and with all the major regional economic communities in Africa. As a Senior Adviser to the Governments of Sierra Leone (2004 to 2006) and Zambia (2006 to 2008), I managed and delivered high level strategic public sector capacity building programmes and policy advice under EC funding. I have also recently completed two major regional projects in 2010, one with the East African Community where as team leader I led the expert team that developed a regional customs strategy for the period 2011 to 2015, the second with Economic Commission of West African States (ECOWAS) where again as team leader I provided technical assistance support to the ECOWAS Commission in developing a strategy for the EPA Services Negotiations with the European Union. In these and other Lead Consultant positions, I have performed policy analysis and impact assessments, developed international trade negotiation briefs, assisted Governments and regional integration bodies in multi-lateral trade negotiations and drafted, implemented, and monitored economic policies, business laws, and regulations. I have also written a number of articles and published technical reports on trade issues, aid for trade, the Millennium Development Goals and on private sector development, and have made many notable international public presentations. BFP: What is the best part about your job? TS: The best part is seeing the realisation of Africa&#8217;s potential as the last frontier of global economic development. I also enjoy interacting with African business people and public sector policy makers keen to unleash the potential of private enterprise in Africa. It is also of course a great pleasure to travel to all these wonderful African countries and see the beauty and warmth of the people, from Cape to Cairo through Addis Ababa and all the way to vibrant Lagos and Accra to the beautiful beaches of the Gambia and the culture of Dakar to the teeming metropolis of Johannesburg &#8211; Africa is a just a great place to live and do business in. BFP: What has been your greatest challenge? TS: The greatest challenge has been getting African politicians to understand the need for enhanced regional integration within Africa. The multiplicity of regional bodies harms Africa more than it helps. We need to consolidate regional integration Africa-wide. We also face the challenge of institutional capacity within African Governments that lends itself to inadequate checks and balances. BFP: How have you overcome these challenges? What has been the secret of your success? TS: By being very analytical and thorough in my work. I always ensure I collect as much empirical data as possible to back up my recommendations. The secret of my success has been my philosophy that &#8220;all things are possible to him that believes&#8221;. I also believe it&#8217;s important to network effectively with key stakeholders and maintain a positive attitude always. In all my work I ensure that local experts are empowered and everywhere I have worked I have mentored and coached many experts that today are leading experts in their various countries. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do, where should they start? TS: Start by deciding on an area of specialisation. I decided to focus on trade and investment related assignments in international development. Also have a firm philosophy. I believe strongly that the private sector is critical to fighting poverty. BFP: Finally: what do you hope to get out of being part of this community? TS: I value the opportunity to network with like-minded people. I am also interested in having access to new contacts and networks and also knowledge sharing and learning from others with different perspectives. I think it’s great that finally business is recognized as a key component of poverty reduction. Editor&#8217;s Note: Thank you to Trevor Simumba for taking the time to do this interview.

20972,Ian Anderson,https://businessfightspoverty.org/ian-anderson,"BFP: What do you do? IA: I am the Africa Programme Manager at the Gatsby Charitable Foundation, a charitable foundation based in London. I am one of a small team of 4 people working on the Foundation’s grant-making activities in East Africa. The Foundation runs a small number of long-term sector development programmes in Africa, focused on promoting economic development and poverty alleviation through creating jobs and creating incomes for the poor. The Gatsby Foundation’s general approach to economic development, similar to many others working in this field, is to focus on “making markets work” (see for example, www.m4phub.org). We see ourselves as facilitators: we identify gaps in markets and try to change the way those markets work so that the gaps no longer exist (rather than just using aid to fill the gaps). So, for example, we may work on changing incentives in a market through addressing inefficiencies in a regulatory system; or, in some cases, we may identify a lack of capacity within public institutions or the private sector, and work to address that. The Foundation does not itself implement programmes, but we are very hands-on and work very closely with delivery partners on the ground. Much of my work is concerned with coordinating our various stakeholders in both the public and private sectors. These include government representatives and NGOs active in the area we’re interested in; while on the private sector side we engage with the whole range from bigger local businesses through to smallholder farmers. Most of the Gatsby Foundation’s programmes have a rural agricultural focus and so that part of the private sector is of particular interest to us. My job also involves research: to identify market gaps and appropriate sectors for the Foundation to become involved in; to identify potential delivery partners and other stakeholders; and to facilitate good programme decisions and resource allocation. BFP: What is the best part about your job? IA: The single best point for me is the sheer variety of issues that I get to deal with, and the level of interest this holds. This is definitely one of the advantages of working for a smaller foundation, where you deal with the whole range of issues, whereas with bigger organisations you can end up over-specialising in one particular area. I also really value the ambition of our organisation to have the greatest possible impact with a relatively small budget – the Africa programme has between £5-6 million available to allocate each year, and finding the best ways to make that money work as hard as possible for as many people as possible is highly motivating and rewarding. BFP: What has been your greatest challenge (around business and development)? IA: As I mentioned earlier, we work across a very broad range of stakeholders, of which the private sector would be only one, and it is often challenging to communicate effectively with the private sector stakeholders in that context. I know many other Business Fights Poverty members have experience with working closely with the private sector, particularly some of the bigger multinational companies, and have managed to launch projects in partnership with these big companies that achieve great impact. However, we tend to work in countries and markets that are not clearly dominated by one large private sector player, but rather many smaller players; and which usually also include both large numbers of smallholder farmers and a significant legitimate role for the public sector. We find that there is a lot of mistrust and mutual suspicion between these groups, and getting them to work together can require enormous effort. (Incidentally, the mistrust of the private sector applies not only to international companies but also local, African businesses.) We sometimes find that we work so hard to change attitudes to business among government and farmers that we neglect engaging adequately with the businesses themselves. BFP: How have you overcome these challenges? What lessons have you learnt? IA: In my experience the most important factor is to have a strong local presence. For someone like me who only spends a proportion of my time on the ground at projects (I spend around 25% of my time in Africa, but this gets divided between the various countries and programmes we work on) it is essential to work through local people, to help us establish a real indigenous footprint in the local community. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do, where should they start? IA: What originally drew me to my job was a desire to do something that has social impact. I started off with a classic “gap year”, travelling to Africa before I started at university in Africa and spending a year on an AIDS education programme in a remote Tanzanian village. I completed my degree and got some private sector experience working for a consultancy for 3 years, where I tried to spend as much time as possible in places like India, trying to understand the drivers of poverty and development in that environment. On leaving the consultancy firm I did a 3-month volunteering stint with Technoserve in Ghana and then applied for a job at Gatsby. I deliberately targeted a smaller organisation because of the prospect of working closely on a wide range of issues. BFP: Finally: what do you hope to get out of being part of this community? IA: I find it very useful as a way of keeping up with the work of others in the field – many people seem to use Business Fights Poverty to announce new projects, reports or results. It is also a good networking platform – several people have used the BFP route to get in touch with me. In the past I also attended and enjoyed several BFP events (though lately I have had less time for that). Editor&#8217;s Note: Thank you to Ian Anderson for taking the time to do this interview.

20978,Barbara Wettstein,https://businessfightspoverty.org/barbara-wettstein,"BFP: What do you do? BW: I work as public affairs specialist at Nestlé. I currently focus on our work in Creating Shared Value (CSV) and more specifically on the Nestlé Prize in Creating Shared Value. At Nestlé, we believe that for a company to be successful over time, it needs to create value for both its shareholders and for society. This is what we call ‘Creating Shared Value’, based on the concept developed by Michael Porter and Mike Kramer. Based on strong foundations of compliance and sustainable business practices, Creating Shared Value is the basic way we do business. Given the nature of our activities, we have identified three areas where we can specifically optimise the creation of shared value: nutrition, water and rural development. One example in the area of rural development is our efforts to link farmers and smallholders to markets through efficient supply chains. To achieve this we carry out capacity-building programmes for farmers around the world. In 2010, 144,900 farmers were trained by Nestlé’s agronomists. In 2009, we launched the Nestlé Prize in Creating Shared Value which is awarded in alternate years and is open to not-for-profit organisations, small enterprises as well as individuals. The Prize aims at rewarding innovative, sustainable, financially-viable solutions to nutrition, water or rural development challenges in developing countries. BFP: What is the best part about your job? BW: There are many aspects I enjoy about my job. I work for the private sector but with a link to the not-for-profit sectors. I get to meet and interact with many different people and organisations, including NGOs, international organisations, government officials, and other businesses. Internally, I also get to work with many different departments and functions. This provides great learning opportunities and an overview of everything we do as a company. I also enjoy the fact that I get the opportunity to communicate about our great initiatives and programmes in the area of nutrition, water and rural development. There are some very inspiring initiatives! BFP: What has been your greatest challenge? BW: The concept of creating shared value is not always well understood by stakeholders, although the general understanding has been improving. With the Nestlé Prize in Creating Shared Value we seek to encourage projects that apply this way of thinking. We look for innovative, replicable projects based on sound and viable business models and in need of funds to be scaled up. The objective of the investment Nestlé makes in the winning project &#8211; up to 500 000 Swiss francs – is really about helping it to scale up and to become financially sustainable over time. We find that the best projects are those that create income opportunities for their beneficiaries. This is quite different from traditional aid and development approaches. But there are some great examples of creating shared value in practice or in planning, either carried out by not-for-profit organisations or private enterprises, and we aim to incentivise development of the best examples worldwide. BFP: How have you overcome these challenges? What has been the secret of your success? BW: The first Prize Laureate, International Development Enterprises (IDE) Cambodia, is a great example of how the concept of creating shared value can be applied by a not-for-profit organisation. This has helped us communicate about the concept more broadly to stakeholders and potential Prize applicants. IDE Cambodia has developed a micro-franchise model to deliver high-quality agricultural products (such as good quality seeds, fertilizer, irrigation equipment), services (collection and marketing) and technical advice to smallholder farmers through independent micro-entrepreneurs, also called farm business advisors, living in rural areas. This innovative, market-based approach is helping small-scale farmers become more effective producers and marketers, thereby increasing their revenue, while the farm business advisors earn additional income from selling their products and services at a profit. The objective of IDE Cambodia is to spin off the franchise into a self-sustaining social enterprise. This is a great example of creating shared value in action: the system flourishes only if there is real value being created at the farm level so everyone in the project is heavily invested in the farmers’ success. We also find that more and more stakeholders and organisations, including multinational companies, are talking about the creating shared value concept, which I think is great. It means that more and more people recognize the positive role that the private sector can have on development. As a company, we try to contribute to the diffusion of this concept, not only through the Prize but also through our annual Creating Shared Value Forum, which aims at providing a platform for global business leaders and other stakeholders to offer fresh thinking on how businesses, governments and not-for-profit organisations can work together to close the gap between commercial needs and development goals. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do, where should they start? BW: I don’t think there is a specific background required &#8211; we have very different backgrounds in the team. I think that being genuinely convinced about the significant role business can play in development is key. Also, speaking several ‘languages’, the business and development language, is definitely important. BFP: Finally: what do you hope to get out of being part of this community? BW: Business Fights Poverty is a great website to learn about other initiatives happening in the area of inclusive business and to connect with others working in this field. For me it is like LinkedIn but much more focused. It brings together people passionate about their work and this is very inspirational.

20981,Tom Rippin,https://businessfightspoverty.org/tom-rippin,"BFP: What do you do? TR: I run On Purpose, a social enterprise I set up just over 2 years ago. On Purpose is a leadership programme for the next generation of high-flyers who want to use the power of business to make a difference in the world. On Purpose identifies high-calibre individuals with 2-5 years’ work experience who are looking to become involved in the social sector, and helps to kick-start their careers by providing paid work experience in cutting-edge, purpose-driven organisations, along with world class training and support and unparalleled access to networks. During the year-long programme we organise two six-month, paid placements for each Associate in some of the most respected purpose-driven enterprises, including the Young Foundation, Comic Relief and O2, providing real-life experience of large, small, established and start-up enterprises; corporations, not-for-profits and charities; all with a common purpose of operating for good in a commercial way. We also work with current and former professionals from prestigious organisations across all sectors to provide world-class training, and each Associate receives regular mentoring support and career planning advice. This year 11 Associates will complete the programme; next year that will grow to between 15 and 20 and we are in the process of recruiting Associates right now. I started this business because of the mismatch I observed between the supply and demand of skills in the purpose-driven business space. On one hand, large and growing numbers of young people in their 20s and 30s have ambitions to work in this space and spend time and money obtaining excellent qualifications at business schools and universities – only to find that the barriers to entry into this job market are actually very high. There are not that many great jobs going – even for volunteers – because in fact there are not that many well-established social enterprises that recruit on a large scale. On the other hand, we have this phenomenon of countless promising social enterprises starting up but very few achieving scale. While the lack and type of funding available to enterprises in the social space is certainly a contributing factor, I believe at least part of the reason for the failure to achieve scale is that many organisations lack the type of people who will drive the scale-up. Many social enterprises are started and run by visionary founders who move mountains to get their enterprises launched. These founders are, however, not always the right people to scale organisations; it takes a different mentality, skill-set and set of motivations to make this happen. In the commercial sector, this type of leader is often referred to as a “builder” or “runner”; because this is a relatively new field the incentives to draw in “builders and runners” are not yet fully in place. Thus a vicious circle is formed where social enterprises don’t grow because it’s difficult to find “builders and runners”, while “builders and runners” don’t get jobs at the social enterprises because they’re not growing. Through On Purpose we’re trying to address both of these problems. Up to now I’ve been running the business on my own for most of the time – albeit with lots of volunteer help, support from our advisory board and in-kind support from the many companies we work with &#8211; so my job includes everything from strategic and budget planning and management to answering the phone. However now that we are recruiting more Associates for 2012 we are planning to grow the team in the next few months. BFP: What is the best part about your job? TR: The rewards for me are two-fold. First, I get to work with amazing people – a range of very interesting, talented and driven individuals participate in our programme, and I have the fantastic privilege of helping them find a career which will provide them with the opportunity to make a real contribution and add significant social value. Second, because of the way we work I am fortunate to find myself in a highly networked place, surrounded by purpose-driven organisations that span the social and commercial world. It is very exciting to be able to forge these connections. BFP: What has been your greatest challenge? TR: It was tough initially to find the organisations willing to sign up to the programme, pay our modest fees and accept our Associates as paid employees for a 6-month period – very few organisations have experience of working with the kind of individual we place and they therefore don’t know what to expect or how to value it. This is exacerbated by the fact that the social sector is awash with people who are prepared to work for very little or no money for the sake of gaining relevant experience. In a sense we were expecting organisations to take a punt on something they did not know. Now that we have a track record and are able to demonstrate value this part is becoming much easier. In terms of the process of setting up the business, funding has been a challenge. Although we are now self-funding it took a while for us to get here, partly because in my original planning I had envisaged that we would be able to obtain some grant funding to help see us through the start-up phase and help us scale up quickly &#8211; and this has proved very time-consuming and difficult to achieve. Most donors and foundations prefer to support single-issue ventures, and because of the nature of our business we don’t easily fit into their funding categories. As for private capital, the challenge there is that many wealthy individuals made their money in the commercial world and may not necessarily be convinced of the value of social enterprise &#8211; in fact they often prefer to give their money to philanthropic causes. BFP: How have you overcome these challenges? What lessons have you learnt? TR: I would advise anyone setting up a social enterprise not to rely too heavily on grant funding to get you through the early stages; but to plan from the outset to be self-funding as soon as possible. Even if you do not generate profits initially, the fact that you will not have to chase funding will save a lot of time and effort which you can invest instead in growing your enterprise. I would also caution anyone thinking about doing something similar to prepare themselves for the roller-coaster ride that is the start-up – you need to be absolutely committed and to remain very focused to make it happen. And don’t be afraid to ask for help during those difficult early days &#8211; I have been amazed at the great willingness of so many people to help and support me in this process. A third bit of advice would be to get a group of trusted advisers around you if you’re trying to get things off the ground on your own. I didn’t have an advisory board around me initially but once this was created I found it hugely helpful to have a group of people committed to helping me succeed and to provide advice and support when I really needed it. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do, where should they start? TR: I started in academia; and once I decided I wanted to get into development I chose to get some training and work experience in the business sector by joining McKinsey, a leading consulting firm. After 5 years I moved across to the not-for-profit sector where I worked with Comic Relief and (RED) before setting out to create On Purpose. However, when I started out I had no idea that this would be where I would end up – I think the important thing is to be open to possibilities. Some private sector experience is undoubtedly very helpful. BFP: Finally: what do you hope to get out of being part of this community? TR: Although I am not the most frequent user of Business Fights Poverty, I do find it very useful as a place to find like-minded people, who are interested in using business to have a positive social impact. BFP is of course also potentially a very useful source for On Purpose to find potential partners – both in terms of companies that could provide placement opportunities, training and mentoring, or job opportunities to our Associates, and for potential candidates to participate in our programme. * * * * * More information about becoming an On Purpose Associate can be found here.

20984,Liz Winton,https://businessfightspoverty.org/liz-patterson,"BFP: What do you do? LW: I am a Private Sector Development Adviser for the UK’s Department for International Development (DFID). In my previous position I was closely involved in the development of two of DFID’s private sector-focused initiatives, the Business Call to Action (now managed by UNDP) and the Business Innovation Facility. In January, a new Private Sector Department was created within DFID, and I now work in that department in the Investment and Finance team. Within this team, my focus is on impact investment – investment that deploys capital in ventures that have the potential to generate social returns in terms of lives impacted, additional capital leveraged and innovative goods and services that serve the poor at scale and are sustainable in the long run. We are currently in the process of scoping out DFID’s work in this relatively new area: identifying key players, challenges and opportunities. DFID wants to catalyse the impact investment market in and for developing countries in order to maximize its development impact, among other things by increasing access to and affordability of basic goods and services that improve the standard of living for people at the base of the pyramid, such as food, shelter, healthcare, education, clean water and energy; accelerating wealth creation and asset accumulation; and increasing access for SMEs to capital, domestic and international markets, technology, know-how and information. BFP: What is the best part about your job? LW: I love the opportunity to be creative and innovative in finding new ways to use DFID’s funding in order to leverage further investment from others and achieve scale. There is a real chance to have a wide impact and to bring positive benefits to many people’s lives – not many jobs offer that possibility! BFP: What has been your greatest challenge? LW: Shifting mindsets away from conventional views is an ongoing challenge. In some donor and government circles people still tend to view the private sector with some suspicion, and question their role in advancing the development agenda. DFID has moved a long way from those traditional views, as is clear from the creation of the Private Sector Department. BFP: How have you overcome these challenges? What has been the secret of your success? LW: I really believe in the importance of showing results – the best way to change mindsets is to demonstrate a measurable impact and to show how you can achieve scale. This will persuade others to follow suit. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do, where should they start? LW: Personally, I always knew that I wanted to work in development. I did a degree in International Economics and applied to the civil service. I started in the Treasury Department where I acquired many useful skills for engaging with the private sector, worked on development finance and trade issues and then after a few years moved across to DFID. However, although I started off in the civil service, I would advise anyone wanting to work in this field to get some private sector experience as it is really useful to be able to engage with business from a position of understanding and experience. BFP: Finally: what do you hope to get out of being part of this community? LW: I get a lot of value out of BFP’s events in London. I also find it a very useful source of information about what is going on in other parts of the donor community. * * * * * For more information about DFID’s approach to private sector development and working with the private sector, please see: DFID’s Private Sector Development Strategy Secretary of State Andrew Mitchell’s speech on the role of the private sector in wealth creation Secretary of State Andrew Mitchell&#8217;s speech on business opportunities in Africa BFP Blog, 6 January 2011 The UK&#8217;s Department for International Development launches new Private Sector Department BFP Blog, 18 October 2010 Listen to the UK Aid Minister&#8217;s speech on the importance of the private sector BFP Blog, 13 October 2010 UK Aid Minister announces &#8220;a new era of private sector-led development work&#8221; Editor&#8217;s Note: Thank you to Liz Winton for taking the time to do this interview.

20987,Wolfgang Weinmann,https://businessfightspoverty.org/wolfgang-weinmann,"BFP: What do you do? WW: I am the Head of Strategic Development for Cafédirect. In this position I am responsible for the strategic direction of the company and its positioning as a sustainability leader and pioneer in demonstrating long-term business value through incorporating environmental, economic, social and ethical perspectives into its business model. I am leading the successful implementation of existing and the launch of new innovative interventions, which also implies bringing about and embedding change in accordance with the Cafédirect culture and values. As member of the Executive Team I also contribute to the overall strategic direction and leadership of the business. BFP: What is the best part about your job? WW: The ability to really make a difference to the lives of smallholder growers worldwide… to have a direct impact! Ours is a fascinating business model that links growers to markets and consumers to ethical and sustainability issues in a way that generates fair value and benefits for everyone involved. My job also gives me space to constantly come up with new ways of doing business and pushing the boundaries of sustainability in the wider sense, balancing out financial, social and environmental challenges. BFP: What has been your greatest challenge? WW: Precisely to find this balance &#8211; we are after all a business, not a charity &#8211; so in order to stay a viable business we constantly have to ask the right questions and find solutions that work for everyone… no mean feat when you think that we trade with 280,000 smallholder farmers in 13 developing countries across Latin America, Asia and Africa and are operating in one of the most competitive retail markets in the world in a category, hot beverages, that is dominated by big brands. One concrete example: back in 2005-6 we identified as part of our environmental strategy that it is not enough for a responsible business just to focus on climate change mitigation issues, but to see the other side of the coin – adaptation to climate change as well. This of course is very relevant to a business that trades in agricultural products sourced from vulnerable smallholder communities in tropical climates. However, sitting down with the farmers and convincing them of the importance of this topic was another matter. And fairly so – for a tea/ coffee farmer in Kenya or Peru the whole notion of long term climate change scenarios and impacts was very remote and sort of far-fetched if you have to tackle more imminent problems like food security, housing, water, health and education etc.; engaging with us to discuss climate change, its impact on their livelihoods and finding answers on how to address this was not one of their priorities. BFP: How have you overcome these challenges? What has been the secret of your success? WW: In our case what works is a partnership approach that fosters trust and working-together. For us the farmers are not mere suppliers of a raw material, they are partners in the business and actually around 77% of them are also shareholders of Cafédirect. This allows for a completely different kind of engagement with them: they trust us, they know that we are in it for the long term, that for us it is about changing livelihoods as well as making great tasting products and being successful as a business together. Hence, sustainability, including social impact, has to be at the heart of a business strategy not at the fringe and all internal stakeholders, from investors to Board to employees have to demonstrate commitment and a long-term view in order to get tangible results. So, on a complex topic like adaptation to climate change you have to approach this with farmers via Making the case: why this is relevant to their livelihoods Making the link: how this will affect the sustainability of the whole business relationship and set-up Making available the required investment: sharing the cost Ensuring ownership of the process for them In the end, we started back in 2005/6 a fascinating journey on climate change adaptation for coffee/ tea/ cocoa smallholders which today has become a major topic and piece of work, not only within the international development agencies but also the coffee and tea industry. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do, where should they start? WW: I think, for a start, to be really open-minded, seeing business in a wider context and the positive role it can play in tackling poverty worldwide. Very often the private sector does get heavy criticism for its performance and negative impact in developing countries – and rightly so; we need inspirational business leaders who can change that. And this in turn requires people from diverse backgrounds in every sense, for example geographically, but also type of expertise. It’s the richness of thinking and approach that will provide fresh answers to the challenge of business fighting poverty. BFP: Finally: what do you hope to get out of being part of this community? WW: I find it useful for collaborating on issues that we don’t have the answers to ourselves – sustainability, particularly around social issues, is a constantly and fast moving territory, throwing up new challenges all the time. It is also a good place for learning about new innovative ways for businesses to have impact in developing countries – there is still much more scope for businesses to contribute decisively to the development agenda and embrace it wholeheartedly as an opportunity. Business Fights Poverty provides an excellent platform to engage with like-minded people and companies. Editor&#8217;s Note: Thank you to Wolfgang Weinmann for taking the time to do this interview.

20990,Peter Davis,https://businessfightspoverty.org/peter-davis,"BFP: What do you do? PD: I am a Research Fellow in the Private Sector and Markets programme at the Overseas Development Institute (ODI). Whereas ODI’s focus has historically been on “traditional” development, working mainly with donors and other large-scale funders, our team concentrates specifically on the private sector and its relevance to the development agenda. The Private Sector and Markets programme is broadly divided into 3 work streams. First, policy and regulatory issues (for example, looking at how emerging market governments can encourage private sector development whilst ensuring that the private sector generates as much benefit as possible to the development agenda). A second stream considers how donors and governments can support private sector development in developing countries. And third, the corporate engagement stream, which looks at how corporate activity contributes to development and how this impact can be enhanced. My focus is on this third area. I deal largely with multinational companies; this group includes not only the very large multinationals such as BP and Heineken, but also the bigger regional multinationals such as MTN. My objective is to work with those companies that are engaged, as part of their core business, in many activities that could be termed “development”, and to find ways in which the development community can engage productively with these businesses. As part of my work, I focus on the various tools that have been developed in the past decade and a half which seek to optimise the private sector’s contribution to development, and to try to work out whether these tools are effective. The Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, for example, has been very successful, yet it addresses only a small part of the corporate impact on development. Are ideas like EITI++ worth pursuing, or do we need to look for other models to use? In particular, I think that the work that John Ruggie has done to develop the ‘Protect, Respect, Remedy’ framework for managing business and human rights is extremely interesting. I want to look at whether and how it might be possible to apply this framework more broadly. I also want to look the role of the UN Global Compact: how can it help develop a more strategic engagement between UN agencies and the corporate sector. BFP: What is the best part about your job? PD: Although I have been in my position for less than two months, I am excited about the opportunity to influence the agenda through my work for an influential and respected policy think-tank such as ODI. Over the past few years, I’ve done a lot at the operational end with both companies and donor agencies. My role at ODI offers me the possibility to bring that experience to bear at a policy level. BFP: What has been your greatest challenge? PD: It is a huge challenge to find ways to describe something that seems so obvious to one party, to another for whom it is less so, in terms that party can relate to and understand. This is more than a language problem – it relates to the very different world views often held by two parties who want to try and collaborate on an area where they believe there could be mutual interest and benefit, but whose approaches differ so much that the common ground is not visible to them. Finding ways to improve mutual understanding and help them see things in a different light can be very difficult. BFP: What advice can you give others faced with a similar challenge? PD: First of all, don’t be judgmental – the mere fact that someone sounds like they want something different from you does not make them wrong. Second, take your time and listen to people carefully to understand exactly what they need. You need to build trust between parties – once people trust that you are not judging them and that you will really listen, they will open up and talk more freely about their real objectives. I think of this process as “conversational triangulation” – you need to navigate a course between parties through your communication with them, the way a ship navigates using known points of reference. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do, where should they start? PD: There’s a lot of pressure on people to plan their careers in minute detail. The world doesn’t work like that though, and I’ve always been more organic in the choices I’ve made. Always try to do things that are challenging, and don’t be scared of challenging the status quo. You’ll find many people working in this space who are square pegs in round holes – and happily so. It doesn’t matter how you get to where you want to be. What matters is that you do something that you enjoy – if you enjoy what you’re doing, you are bound to be good at it and progress and succeed. In this area where two worlds overlap (business and development) I think it is also important to be flexible in your thinking and open to different points of view. BFP: Finally: what do you hope to get out of being part of this community? PD: A community like this gives you a chance to find out what you don’t know – and what you didn’t even know you don’t know! There is also a lot of value in being able to bounce ideas around and get different perspectives from people who share your interest and may have faced similar challenges. It is always reassuring to know that there are others who are trying to push a rock up the same hill. Editor&#8217;s Note: Thank you to Peter Davis for taking the time to do this interview.

20993,Ellen Kallinowsky,https://businessfightspoverty.org/ellen-kallinowsky,"BFP: What do you do? EK: I work as coordinator for cooperation with the private sector in Africa within GIZ, the German development agency. At GIZ, we believe that collaboration between the public and private sector and civil society is a precondition for achieving political stability, economic growth and sustainable development. We therefore offer support and advisory services to build the capacity of public and private institutions as well as civil society in Africa to strengthen their collaboration. In Tanzania for example we support the Ministry of Health in their policy and strategy on public-private partnerships (PPPs) and in the set up of a PPP-unit. Another example is our support to the SADC secretariat in their effort to give policy guidance and regulations on PPPs for their member states. GIZ also engages in concrete development partnerships with companies. Right now, we have over 70 ongoing development partnerships in Africa. These vary both in size and sector. For example, we collaborate with Sasol and a municipality in South Africa to decrease water leakages; together with Shell in Gabon we strengthen capacity of local stakeholders to implement a regional development strategy; and in Kenya we support business associations in their fight against corruption. BFP: What is the best part about your job? EK: The tasks are so diverse! Today I sit down with managers from a multinational company seeking advice on how to sustain their operations in a region with political unrest and social uproar. Tomorrow I discuss with my colleagues in-country on how to explore in a bilateral program on government decentralization the potential role of the private sector in service delivery at municipal level. I contribute to technical concepts and policy papers for our Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development and assist my team in the acquisition of concrete partnerships with the private sector in Africa. The work of GIZ itself in Africa is so diverse, and in all aspects of GIZ’s work there is scope to explore in more detail how to strengthen the collaboration between state, private sector and civil society towards more sustainable development. It never gets boring! BFP: What has been your greatest challenge? EK: The role of the private sector in Africa hasn’t been and isn’t always positive. There are so many unfortunate experiences with the social, environmental and governance performance of companies. Human rights and labour rights violations, child work and slavery, outrageous environmental pollution, corruption and a total lack of social concern &#8211; we see it out there every day. Establishing the concept of corporate citizenship within business and politics in Africa requires urgent attention, great effort and endurance. It is imperative, if we want to preach the mantra of more cross-sector collaboration and partnerships for sustainable development, that decision makers within companies change their attitude towards a more responsible business agenda. BFP: How have you overcome these challenges? What has been the secret of your success? EK: There are great leaders and managers out there who work hard on that responsibility agenda. We have the possibility to help them to establish and manage responsible business fora &#8211; we have been supporting CSR fora throughout Africa for the last 8 years. To see how individuals personally engage in these fora to contribute towards more corporate responsibility is highly motivating. Thus the role GIZ plays is one of a capacity builder: we don’t take ownership, we don’t need to be in the front line, but we are a long-term partner for change agents in Africa. Through the programs from our Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development, but also from other donors and clients, GIZ is in a good position to be flexible and to be able to act fast. We can engage in concrete development partnerships with companies with little bureaucratic procedures; we can play a mediator role and convene public private policy dialogues between government, private sector and civil society; we can assist in the design of regulatory frameworks for cooperation between the societal actors etc. The mix of our services makes it possible to really offer the right portfolio for each situation on the ground. My role therefore is to understand the potential, to transfer the private sector expectations into a development language that makes sense for public authorities and development agencies; and to mobilize exactly that right mix of services in order to turn ideas and energy into real action and impact. The secret to my success might be a combination of working for a great organization, having experience of working and living in Africa, continuously building a strong network of change agents within the private sector in Africa, and giving others the lead and the credit if things go well while taking personally the blame if things go wrong. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do, where should they start? EK: Personally engage! It is not important which diplomas and degrees one carries, it is important which personal commitment one brings along. This is what qualifies individuals to work in the development arena or to take leadership within the private sector as a responsible business change agent. BFP: Finally: what do you hope to get out of being part of this community? EK: I would like to learn more about other initiatives and to get to know people who engage, who are making a difference. I would like to understand how and whether this network could be linked to some of the work of GIZ and whether there is potential for collaboration. So I’d be more than happy to hear from members of the community who are working in Africa on development partnerships or CSR. * * * * GIZ has set up a web site, Cooperation with the Private Sector in Africa which captures, amongst other things, new partnership projects, capacity development concepts, CSR-Networks, initiatives for fighting corruption, and regulation efforts through regional economic commissions. There is also a newsletter which keeps you informed on a regular basis. Editor&#8217;s Note: Thank you to Ellen for taking the time to do this interview.

20996,Laura Hartman,https://businessfightspoverty.org/laura-hartman,"BFP: What do you do? LH: I have several responsibilities, though I certainly would claim one as my career choice. I am Vincent de Paul Professor of Business Ethics in DePaul University’s College of Commerce (Chicago, USA) and Special Assistant to the university president for DePaul’s Haiti Initiatives. I am also Research Director of DePaul’s Institute for Business and Professional Ethics. In addition, I serve as Director of External Partnerships for Zynga.org, the social strategy arm of Zynga Game Network. In each of these positions, much of my work focuses on the role that for-profits can play in poverty alleviation. In my academic capacity and with various co-authors, I have written books, articles and cases designed to showcase innovative and profitable partnerships between businesses and those living in poverty, which bring significant benefits to all stakeholders. I also helped to establish Zafèn, an online portal that connects lenders or donors from around the world with micro-entrepreneurs in Haiti, and I am working with an NGO called FATEM to build a school in Haiti (scheduled to open this Fall, 2011). Through Zynga.org, we have put these concepts into practice. Partnering with nonprofit organizations through many of its online gaming franchises, Zynga has contributed substantial amounts of funding (more than $10 million) to a number of global and US-based causes while simultaneously increasing its market share and strengthening relationships with its player base. Zynga.org focuses on carefully selecting partnerships that simultaneously strengthen the traditional business metrics of success &#8211; profitability, competitive advantage, growing market share &#8211; by offering players desirable and meaningful virtual social goods that they seek through the games, and contributing to important causes, including poverty alleviation in Haiti and emergency relief efforts after the earthquake and tsunami in Japan. BFP: What is the best part about your job? LH: The most rewarding part of what I do is that each of my various jobs culminates in some way in a positive impact on fundamental human rights, usually for those who do not have the most powerful voices in our communities. In addition, I value the opportunity to bring attention to these creative partnerships that deserve the spotlight. Business is often viewed either in a neutral manner – or worse – in connection with poverty alleviation. To the contrary, case after case demonstrates that it has the capacity to act as a valuable and necessarily vested participant in its reduction. BFP: What has been your greatest challenge? LH: It is exactly the hurdle I mention above – changing the mental models among all stakeholders involved. Not only is there a mentality of silos where each player perceives that they would be able to resolve the challenges faced by those living in poverty, if only the entity had sufficient capital, but business is seen as an inherently suspect partner in these ventures, with their motivation questioned at every turn. BFP: How have you overcome these challenges? What has been the secret of your success? LH: I began my career teaching in the area of employment discrimination (and still co-author a book on it for business execs). In that arena, we suggest that proximity and greater understanding is one way to move toward enhanced empathy; the more you know people as individuals, the more that our stereotypes fall by the wayside. Applied to general business transactions, the more we know people on the other side of a business deal, the more we trust them and therefore understand their motivations. Borrowing from a somewhat Eastern tradition of business, it is through these deeper relationships that we can build our business partnerships. In my work (academic and applied), I therefore try to get people to understand that for-profit businesses *need* to be motivated by profits – it is how they stay in business, are able to pay their employees, their taxes, produce new products, provide services and so on. With regard to doing business with developing economies, we *want* them to invest rather than to contribute through philanthropy because investments (opening a business, hiring employees, etc.) is more sustainable; so the company will remain in that economy, be committed to it and continue to invest, rather than offer a charitable contribution and perhaps move on. The more a company realizes a benefit in partnership with other stakeholders, the more likely it will continue. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do, where should they start? LH: I love my role as a professor, it should not be called work for me. In fact, I spend most of my waking life engaged in what others might call “work;” but that is a misnomer because it is simply that I do what I believe. I work very hard to make each day worthwhile in the life of someone else; and I find ways to create opportunities to do so. It is not a difficult endeavor to do what I do in that regard since I really believe that those opportunities fall in our path. I want to make sure that each day was worth something and this is simply not that difficult a task for any of us. If someone wants to teach, they should passionately wish to share something with others. Teaching is simply gaining knowledge and then sharing that process with others, hoping that they will learn the process and build something more out of it. Personally, I began with a law degree, rather than a Ph.D., which would have been the normal path to becoming a Full Professor in a business school; but that just demonstrates that there are many paths. BFP: Finally: what do you hope to get out of being part of this community? LH: One of the most gratifying components of being a career academic is that gathering information and learning is a central element of my job. I have learned so much from colleagues in this community and I continue to learn. Understanding alternative perspectives through its diversity, coming to know the visions and aspirations that others have for this world and how we might achieve them, I am better able to generate new visions and aspirations for myself and the organizations of which I am a part.

20999,Graham Baxter,https://businessfightspoverty.org/graham-baxter,"BFP: What do you do? GB: I am Senior Adviser at the International Business Leaders Forum (IBLF). I currently focus on two areas of IBLF’s work, namely inclusive businesses and the leadership agenda. On inclusive business, IBLF partners with a number of organisations on a range of initiatives. I am deeply involved in the work we do with the UNDP’s Business Call to Action. In addition to being one of 8 partners supporting this international initiative, IBLF is specifically responsible for managing the Call to Action’s outreach efforts in India and South East Asia. We also partner with PwC and Accenture Development Partners on the Business Innovation Facility, created and supported by the UK&#8217;s Department for International Development (DFID), which is currently run as a pilot in 5 countries – including Malawi, Nigeria and Zambia. The IBLF contribution centres around our partnering capability and the expertise created via The Partnering Initiative. We are also partners in the Swedish Development Agency, SIDA’s Innovations Against Poverty programme (IAP) which was launched at the end of April. Here our emphasis is on the importance of cross-sectoral partnerships and how they can contribute to successful business innovations that address development issues effectively. BFP: What is the best part about your job? GB: I get a kick out of working with businesses and business leaders who recognise the major contribution they can make to development, especially in emerging markets, through their core business. Whilst CSR is of great importance and corporate philanthropy has a critical role to play, it is most satisfying when businesses realise that they can also make a huge difference to the lives of poor people even as they pursue their normal business objectives of competitive advantage, greater market share and profitability &#8211; as long as they do it responsibly and inclusively. BFP: What has been your greatest challenge? GB: One of the greatest challenges we encounter is to get businesses to sustain their commitment to inclusive business models. Very often, there is an individual in an organisation who “gets” inclusive business, who understands fundamentally that both business and development benefit could be achieved by working in a particular way, and this individual would drive the company’s efforts. But when that individual leaves for say another position or another company – as inevitably happens – the momentum can be fatally lost and the initiative can wither on the vine. This inclusive business work isn’t easy – if it were, everybody would already be doing it! We are asking businesses to do something that is difficult, that might be different from what they know, that requires perseverance and patience; and so support for businesses who embark on this journey is crucial. BFP: How have you overcome these challenges? GB: We can help businesses sustain momentum by championing the cause, so that benefits are appreciated externally which would help to ensure ongoing support internally. We can also help the organisations understand the benefits of this kind of investment to the business – some of these business models and programmes are a bit slow to deliver, and the payback is often longer than what they may be used to, so a great degree of patience is required. The slow return also makes such programmes more fragile, of course, especially in straitened economic times. IBLF can help by amplifying the message through its networks and facilitating partnerships with other organisations on similar journeys. We also provide access to a mutual support group, which gives businesses engaged on this journey the opportunity to join a community of practice where they can share experiences learn from each other in a non-competitive environment. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do, where should they start? AW: Do it from where you are. For example, I started as a geologist in the oil and gas sector, then became a commercial manager and later a communications professional in the corporate responsibility area of the business, before I became more involved in inclusive business. I can only do this job because I understand business and how companies operate. My advice would be to get as much experience as possible in the business world – it can be difficult for someone coming from the outside to relate to the challenges that companies face. It doesn’t really matter which part of the business you started in, or even if your company has a footprint in a developing country. Any aspect of business gives you the opportunity to explore the interface between business and society, and to consider how you can extend activities to have a greater impact. BFP: Finally, what do you hope to get out of being part of this community? AW: There is nothing like a good story, and people are inspired by other people – reading about their experiences, hearing about their successes and disappointments, watching video footage of projects they’ve worked on – this is by far the most inspiring way of interacting. BFP provides a platform for that kind of powerful personal interaction, and has a certain freshness. The challenge is to optimise the opportunities for sharing; to retain that freshness; and to avoid becoming a venue for impersonal corporate speak and self-promotion.

21002,Michael Jarvis,https://businessfightspoverty.org/michael-jarvis,"BFP: What do you do? MJ: I manage the Governance for Extractive Industries programme at the World Bank Institute. We are a team within the Bank that is committed exclusively to promoting transparency and accountability in the oil, gas and mining sector. Our team engages with the whole spectrum of stakeholders in this sector, acting as connectors and facilitators across different countries and different initiatives. We support companies, governments, and civil society in identifying opportunities to improve existing levels of accountability and transparency. We focus in particular on monitoring the award and implementation of oil, gas and mining agreements, and, working with our Africa Region colleagues, are supporting emerging multi-stakeholder coalitions for contract monitoring in four West African countries. As part of this work we have created GOXI.org, the online network set up in June last year to link practitioners in the extractives sector. GOXI is a space to share, learn and connect for action towards greater accountability and, in turn, better development outcomes of extractive industries in Africa. I also provide input into the work of other teams in the Bank that deal with responsible business, especially those that support business coalitions fighting against corruption and working to improve governance standards. BFP: What is the best part about your job? MJ: I enjoy the fact that I get to interact with so many different organizations and individuals across such a broad range of countries, including national and multinational organizations, donors, businesses and NGOs. I like spotting opportunities for different people and institutions to work together – also inside the Bank, with its 10,000 employees! I enjoy the challenge of spotting who might have the particular expertise or experience that can be helpful on a project. I also appreciate the fact that our work feels very relevant. Extractive issues are of such importance to so many countries in Africa and affect so many people, and will continue to do so for decades to come. In seeking to ensure better outcomes through capacity building support to local decision makers, it is good to know that what we do really matters. I value the chance to learn through practice what approaches can be most effective in delivering change on the ground. BFP: What has been your greatest challenge? MJ: Whereas the business community seems increasingly to be taking on board its role in the development process, I have been a little surprised about the resistance among some in the development community to the idea of working with business. In some quarters suspicions remain about the business agenda, and people find it hard to think of businesses as potential partners. This has been particularly striking in the work we’ve done on tackling malnutrition &#8211; perhaps a result of specific corporate legacy issues in that area. That said, multi-stakeholder efforts benefit from having the range of viewpoints in the room – otherwise it is possible to design something that looks perfect on paper but can be swiftly undermined by those resistant to change. BFP: How have you overcome these challenges? What has been the secret of your success? MJ: It sounds simplistic, but a great starting point is to get people together in the same room and get them talking. Don’t shy away from confrontation. Even when people initially seem to hold directly opposing views, they often find common ground. It helps to move the conversation onto practical issues such as outcomes, and away from ideological debates where there is less scope for agreement. It is useful to identify the areas of similar needs and mutual potential benefit, and to start with small agreements on less controversial issues. You can then keep building the relationship from that basis, working your way towards the more difficult topics. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do, where should they start? MJ: There is no one set path – which of course opens the door to people from many different backgrounds. The main thing to do is to reach out to those already in the position that you’re interested in, and identify entry points through your networks to connect with them. Build new relationships proactively and with enthusiasm, and stay on people’s radar. A need can often appear quite suddenly, and we all tend to reach out to those we know already. This can be a great source of opportunity. Relevant experience is of course always useful but a willingness to learn and to work hard is at least as important. BFP: Finally: what do you hope to get out of being part of this community? MJ: I find Business Fights Poverty very useful as a practical way of connecting with people and staying informed about where the current thinking is heading around CSR and business in development. I find the blogs and events listings especially useful. The scale of the network is a great benefit as it draws in such a wide range of contributors and participants.

21005,Simon Bishop,https://businessfightspoverty.org/simon-bishop,"BFP: What do you do? SB: I am currently working at the heart of a team establishing the first global entity to tackle Indoor Air Pollution (IAP), the harmful smoke from 3 billion people cooking every day on primitive traditional cookstoves. The Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves, a $250m public-private-partnership designed to save lives, improve livelihoods, empower women and combat climate change by creating a thriving global market for clean cooking solutions, was launched by Hillary Clinton at the Clinton Global Initiative (CGI) meeting in September 2010. I am currently seconded from Shell Foundation to the Alliance’s Secretariat, which is based at the United Nations Foundation in Washington D.C. I am heavily involved in everything required to create a new global health-environment organisation, including: a 10-year strategic plan, governance, staffing, fundraising and stakeholder engagement. I am also coordinating a sector-wide consultation process involving 400 global experts across nine Working Groups, covering topics as diverse as Health Research, Carbon Finance and Technology; the first time the global stove community has been convened with the aim of identifying what exactly it is going to take to create a thriving global market for clean cooking solutions. BFP: What is the best part about your job? SB: The potential to make a big positive difference. IAP has historically received limited attention on the global stage, largely for sensible reasons like the fact that the most viable solution – cleaner stoves that significantly reduce fuel use and emissions – has only been partially effective. But technological breakthroughs in stove design, combined with the potential for carbon revenues (cleaner stoves reduce CO2 emissions) that can dramatically lower the $15-100 price tag, means we should be able to sustainably reach hundreds of millions more homes in coming years. It is exciting to think we could reduce the impact of an issue that blights the lives of half the world’s population every day and contributes to climate change. We have a 3-5 year ‘moment’ and we need to grab it. BFP: What has been your greatest challenge? SB: Managing expectations. A year ago the Alliance was an idea on a piece of paper. Five months later we had raised $64m and convinced Hillary Clinton to launch the Alliance at CGI. This was fantastic but it also raised expectations. Any new organisation takes time to establish the basics – strategic plans, governance, staffing etc. When it is an international Alliance spanning the private, NGO, academic and government sectors it is even harder. But we are getting there and we have achieved an enormous amount in a year. BFP: What advice can you give others who want to implement similar initiatives? SB: Keep an eye out for stars-aligning in whichever field you work in. A whole range of stars lined up for us, some out of luck, some through us nudging them into position. You will need to be persistent and there is much to be said for identifying the players you need and then working your way around, nudging each partner inch by inch above the parapet. We had plenty of skeptical voices but having worked away behind the scenes, one day all of these organisations found themselves above the parapet and staring each other in the eye. This produced a combination of confidence to commit – and a feeling of shame if they did not. Once this happened things progressed very quickly. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do, where should they start? SB: I saw the boss of the Shell Foundation on Newsnight in 2005 arguing that while doubling aid was good news it was not going to make poverty history. He argued we needed to get more business thinking and ideas involved in international development to find sustainable, financially-viable solutions to development challenges because they are too big; there is never going to be enough aid to go around. This application of business-thinking to development has since been termed ‘venture philanthropy’ or ‘philanthrocapitalism’ but back then he was almost a lone voice. I had worked in international development at the start of my career but walked away feeling much of it was bureaucratic, inefficient and fundamentally not reducing poverty. I had never come across the idea of applying business ideas to poverty. What a great idea! So I called him up the day after I had seen him on Newsnight and harassed him for a job. It took six months of harassment but I got one in the end. In short: Work out what you are passionate about, find out who does it – then go hassle them for a job. BFP: Finally: what do you hope to get out of being part of this community? SB: Business Fights Poverty is a fabulous entity. It brings together like-minded people and in a world where we are bombarded with information, provides the most relevant stuff in an easy to use platform. I am a big fan.

21009,Jim Tanburn,https://businessfightspoverty.org/jim-tanburn,"BFP: What do you do? JT: I am Coordinator for the Donor Committee for Enterprise Development – an inter-agency body that aims to build agreement among donors and UN agencies around good practice in working with the private sector in developing countries. It does this by providing a forum in which donor and UN agencies can share their practical experience of private sector development (PSD); the Committee then publishes guidelines, based on that experience and on participatory processes for building consensus. The DCED is also a leading source of knowledge about PSD, running a portal for all kinds of knowledge about PSD. Private sector development has recently become much more ‘mainstream’ in donor thinking, although the funding allocations have not necessarily followed the rhetoric just yet. BFP: What is the best part about your job? JT:The opportunity to make a difference – thinking through what donors support, and how they support it, so that they can be more effective in the future. Every donor has a slightly different view on how the private sector could and should develop, and how best to support it. And until they agree on the fundamentals, they are not likely to be able to coordinate very well together on the ground. Much of this goes on ‘behind the scenes’ – although our Standard for Results Measurement has been gaining profile recently. BFP: What has been your greatest challenge? JT: Bridging theory and practice; the DCED has always taken an empirical approach – what do we learn from experience, really? I think we are now moving beyond the previous swings in fashion about specific approaches that ‘always work’ (or not), and towards a greater sense of pragmatism. The best approach is always going to be context-specific, depending on market constraints and opportunities. We need practical interventions, based on excellent understanding of local conditions and delivered by very able people. The DCED Standard provides both the framework and the incentive for programme managers to clarify the logic of their programmes, and this is always going to be helpful: spelling out in a diagram how your inputs are expected to lead to the desired results. Many people find it quite challenging to articulate in any detail the logic of what they are doing, the first time they try. BFP: How have you overcome your challenges? What has been the secret of your success? JT: Some humility is always useful – I am not sure we can claim ‘success’ as such. Progress, of course, and success in bringing people around the table, in an atmosphere of enquiry. The process of agreeing on the various donor guidance documents has been highly participatory, and of great value in itself. It has taken a shared wish to be more effective, taking the time to learn the lessons of experience. It is so important, and not much heralded, that people in development agencies take the time to do this kind of work together. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do – where do they start? JT: Ideally they would start by working in the private sector (as I did). Then they should learn as much as possible about all aspects of PSD. There are many ‘communities of practice’ which often don’t overlap very much, but we need to understand all of them to succeed. What is their world view? What results are they achieving? BFP: And finally: what do you hope to get out of being part of this community? JT: Closer links with the business community would be very helpful. The agendas of business and donors are different, since for example donors are aiming to develop whole markets – not give any one business a world-beating position. And there are real cultural differences to be bridged. Ultimately, though, it would be excellent if donors could build relationships with business, that aren’t just individual partnerships, but are long-term and strategic. Businesses could contribute more, that way. Further reading: The DCED web site features a selection of interesting views on private sector development.

21012,Amanda Gardiner,https://businessfightspoverty.org/amanda-gardiner,"BFP: What do you do? AG: I lead outreach efforts for the Business Call to Action (BCtA), an initiative that challenges companies to develop business models that offer the potential for both commercial success and development impact. I act as the interface with companies on the BCtA: persuading them to join; supporting them through the application process; and providing feedback on the development and implementation of their initiatives. Although I am based at UNDP headquarters in New York, the BCtA is actually a multistakeholder initiative supported by 8 different organisations (UNDP is one). My role also involves managing relations with partners and helping ensure that their strategic priorities are met as far as possible in our direction-setting and outreach to companies. BFP: What is the best part about your job? AG: There are many good parts. To start, I get to speak regularly to some incredibly innovative companies about the new business models they are developing, the impacts they hope to achieve in underserved markets, and the opportunities and challenges they face in implementation. It’s invigorating to have a bird’s eye view of the sea-change that is taking place with regard to perceptions of the private sector’s role in development. And I love having access to individuals who are at the forefront of this change, driving innovation within their companies. I also enjoy the chance to be entrepreneurial about how BCtA adds value to its member companies. Working together as a small team, we are always brainstorming about new ways to support our members in their inclusive business efforts. This may be through the establishment of new relationships – for example, we recently started linking our members to researchers from leading business schools. Or it may be through the use of new technologies – in the last few months, we have reached new audiences by featuring BCtA companies in our emergent webinar series. BFP: What has been your greatest challenge? AG: Even though business is now widely recognized as having a role in to play in development, it still sometimes feels as if the ‘inclusive business’ or ‘shared value’ space is really a very small world. Just getting the message out – that companies can often have some of the most sustainable development impacts by leveraging and adapting their core business models for underserved markets – can be difficult. Sometimes companies just don’t get it, or think it’s too complicated and resource-intensive. Other times they may understand and implement it, but don’t want to talk about their initiatives for competitive reasons or because the coupling of ‘profit-seeking’ with ‘development’ is met with resistance by certain stakeholders. What complicates matters is that when I first reach out to a company I am often put in touch with a CSR or public affairs representative, who may or may not be fully informed about the core business/development agenda and could be coming to the discussion with a social investment or philanthropy perspective. I often have to remind myself that this is not a well-understood space – even within some of the companies and development institutions that champion inclusive business! BFP: What advice can you give others wanting to implement similar initiatives? AG: Go for it! We need more champions for inclusive business, and more recognition for some of the amazing models that companies have already developed. That said, I would caution that you need a lot of patience – it can take a long time for a company expressing an interest in inclusive business to actually move to being able to implement a program (or, in our case, announce an initiative). In addition, the time it takes isn’t always in sync with the expectations of other stakeholders, which can be difficult to manage. We try to maintain frequent and open communication with our BCtA partners in order to ensure that expectations are realistic on all sides and that robust systems are in place to measure and relay progress. Finally, I do think that companies are sometimes struck by initiative fatigue, and so our model is to try and leverage established networks and initiatives instead of replicating what already exists. We find we are able to achieve quite a bit more when we collaborate with other institutions that are paving the way in this field! BFP: If someone wants to do what you do, where should they start? AG: I don’t think there is an ideal background – your route can be very indirect (I started in music!). I do think certain core skills are essential though: you need to believe very passionately that inclusive business is something worth pursuing, as you are likely to meet many people who are not convinced that business should be involved in development, and at times it can feel like you’re hitting a brick wall. Being able to speak the language is important – both the business language and the development language – so that you can reach people on both sides of the conversation effectively. But you should also be able to listen, to earn people’s trust and form strong relationships in an area where there is still misunderstanding and sometimes even suspicion. Lastly, it helps to be able to think on your feet and ad lib on the many occasions when you’ll be asked tough questions! BFP: Finally, what do you hope to get out of being part of this community? AG: For me BFP is the Facebook of the business/development community. I value the social aspect of the network in particular. It gives me the opportunity to meet like-minded professionals and make new contacts. It enables me to see who the movers and shakers are, the people I should try to connect with if I want to stay up to date with latest thinking and developments in this field. I also feel that it provides a ready-made professional support network that I can access should I ever need it (though to date I’ve not used it). There are other sites out there but I think BFP is the best gathering place for interested individuals. The large network of practitioners is its greatest asset.

21015,Petter Matthews,https://businessfightspoverty.org/petter-matthews,"BFP: What do you do? PM: I’m the Executive Director of Engineers Against Poverty (EAP), an independent NGO that works with government, industry and civil society to fight poverty and promote sustainable development. One of our major programmes is the Construction Sector Transparency (CoST) initiative. EAP works with partner organisations to run the CoST International Secretariat. BFP: What is the best part about your job? PM: EAP is involved in developing highly innovative policies, systems and procedures aimed at maximising the development benefits of investments in infrastructure. This involves focusing on things like procurement, supply chain development and risk management. These are routine functions and they aren’t glamorous, but they are the critical areas for interventions aimed at creating jobs, promoting enterprise development and providing training. I enjoy being part of a small organisation that has developed an international reputation as a result of the quality of its work in these important areas. BFP: What has been your greatest challenge? PM: There has been a transformation in corporate attitudes towards civil society since I started working for EAP almost 10 years ago. At that time many companies were suspicious of NGOs and tended to see them as a potential threat. These attitudes were often a result of their experiences of campaigns aimed at changing corporate behavior in relation to environmental or human rights issues. It took them a while to understand that in addition to the campaigning NGOs, there were a growing number of others seeking opportunities to work in collaboration with industry to improve the development impact of business. It took considerable effort to win the trust of potential corporate partners and to find ways of working with them, particularly when they realised that we were interested in their core business operations, rather than their CSR or philanthropic activities. Since then we have developed successful partnerships with leading international companies such as AMEC, Balfour Beatty, Arup and PwC. These companies are very sophisticated in their thinking about relationships with NGOs and recognise the potential value-added of working in cross-sectoral partnerships. BFP: What advice can you give others wanting to implement similar initiatives? PM: Mobilising the development potential of the private sector more effectively is probably the single greatest opportunity to accelerate progress towards the Millennium Development Goals. Individuals who want to help lead this process should consider three things. First, they need to look within their own companies to see what more can be done. The opportunities will vary enormously depending on the nature of their business, but the key to improving the development impact of business is to establish a business case for doing things differently. Their colleagues for example might find numerous reasons not to source more of their goods and services from local suppliers, but if it can be demonstrated that doing so will secure cost efficiencies for the company in the medium to long term, they are more likely to be persuaded. Second, they should learn from what others are doing. Far more is understood now about how to align corporate and societal interests to create mutual beneficial outcomes and a range of tools and approaches are available to support companies in their efforts. Third, they need to ensure that the lessons from experience are absorbed by their companies and used to improve future performance. I’m often surprised that one part of a company is unaware of the experiences of another part of the same company. Organisational learning doesn’t occur spontaneously and they need to develop systems and promote a culture of learning from experience. It’s almost thirty years since Donald Schon developed the idea of organisations enabling people to become ‘reflective practitioners’, but there are still few examples of industry doing it effectively. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do, where should they start? PM: I meet a lot of young engineers who are motivated by a desire to help find solutions to global challenges such as poverty, natural disasters and climate change. They sometimes think that working for an NGO is the best or even the only way to do this. I usually encourage them to go into industry. One of the main drivers of improving the development impact of business in recent years has been the demands and aspirations of employees. Forward-thinking companies understand that to attract and retain the best people, they need to understand their impact on society and seek where possible to align their commercial interests with the interests of the full range of stakeholders who are affected by their operations. NGOs have an important contribution to make, but only industry has the economic power, technological know-how and global reach to scale-up business based solutions to poverty. BFP: Finally: what do you hope to get out of being part of this community? PM: Business Fights Poverty is a tremendous resource for anyone interested in the development impact of business. I use it as a place to meet like-minded people, learn about events and resources and gain inspiration. I’m conscious that it is a resource for me to draw on, but also one that I should contribute to if I want it to attract more members and improve even further.

21018,Graham Clewer,https://businessfightspoverty.org/graham-clewer,"BFP: What do you do? GC: I am the International Director for Fair and Ethical Trade at The Body Shop. In this role I manage the Ethical Trade Programme at The Body Shop, which is concerned with labour rights, standards and working conditions of workers in our global supply chains. We align our work in this area with the UK Ethical Trading Initiative. I also oversee a targeted pro-poor purchasing programme at The Body Shop’s which we call Community Fair Trade. This programme has been running since 1987 and today benefits close to 30,000 people in 24 countries, mostly in marginalised communities. Our mission at The Body Shop is, and has always been, to use business as a force for good. So, in Community Fair Trade we apply a framework of fair trade to sourcing, and principles of fair and ethical trade underpin many of the decisions we make across the business. We seek to use Community Fair Trade ingredients in our products wherever possible – the percentage is rising, it’s now around 80%. This includes some of nature’s finest ingredients, grown and harvested by expert local farmers using time-honoured techniques. It also includes handcrafted gifts and accessories. Through trading directly with these small-scale suppliers – and allowing them to make their own decisions &#8211; we can, in a small way, help to preserve a traditional way of life, while offering them fair, stable, long-term income. This allows them to build better futures for themselves and their communities. The long-term relationships we maintain through our Community Fair Trade programme really do help to radically transform communities. While some of our ingredients are well-known, others are less visible. We are actively involved in raising awareness of the issues involved with sourcing some of these “invisible” ingredients. For example, The Body Shop has just launched the first fairly traded organic alcohol – alcohol can constitute up to 70% of perfume, yet few consumers are aware of its presence, or how it’s sourced. Another key ingredient of cosmetics, and one that I’m really passionate about, is shea butter. Harvested exclusively by women, the global shea trade affects millions of rural women in the informal sector of West Africa. We have been sourcing shea butter through our Community Fair Trade programme for almost 20 years, but the benefits of this setup do not reflect what’s happening in the rest of the industry. So we are founding members of the Global Shea Alliance which aims to bring fairness and sustainability to this important sector. BFP: What is the best part about your job? GC: The sheer diversity of my work always excites me. In a typical day my agenda could cover fair trade and ethical sourcing alcohol, shea nuts, cocoa butter, sugar and wood; I could be discussing farmers from an indigenous tribe in the Amazon one moment and a coconut oil cooperative in the Pacific the next; or participate in a discussion on a responsible business network just before an interview with an Italian beauty magazine. The diversity of issues, products, locations and people makes for a very stimulating environment. BFP: What has been your greatest challenge? GC: Business and development do not always make natural bedfellows, and marrying their sometimes differing agendas has been a challenge. They even speak a different language and this alone can lead to a breakdown of communication and understanding. But the tide is turning. As we know, traditional “business people” are not inclined to think about “development” – they don’t know why they should; business is not conscious of its footprint, or its implications. The challenge is to create a business that acknowledges and understands its footprint in order to optimize and manage it in an ethical and responsible way; to leverage it for all stakeholders, not to exploit it for a few. I guess the biggest challenge is to present the case for responsible business in such a way that those making the decisions wouldn’t want to do it any other way. BFP: What has been the secret of your success? GC: Having a background in industrial and not-for-profit sectors has helped me bridge the communications gap between the conventional business and development communities. I’m a linguist myself, and people interest me. This has enabled me to find a language that is accessible to both sides, which has been hugely important in my position where I often sit between those two worlds. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do, where should they start? GC: Ideally have a combined background in business and in development. Experience of working in a developing country is essential – in order to truly understand what people need it is crucial to spend time with them, in their communities, to really get to understand their circumstances and the challenges they face. Equally, it is important to understand how business thinks and what the drivers are in a corporate context. BFP: Finally: what do you hope to get out of being part of this community? GC: Business Fights Poverty is wide ranging enough to offer something for everyone. I like keeping an eye on conversations, blogs etc to make sure I stay abreast of what other companies and colleagues are doing; it helps me identify potential partners and people I could exchange learnings with. Business Fights Poverty also provides a great platform for advocacy – as I mentioned above I think we have a role to play in global advocacy on important issues such as the Global Shea Alliance, and Business Fights Poverty provides an excellent avenue for this advocacy.

21021,Will Derban,https://businessfightspoverty.org/will-derban,"BFP: What do you do? WD: I am the Head of Community Relations for Barclays Africa. I manage our Community investment strategy across 10 countries in Africa. I develop partnerships with NGOs that provide innovation solutions to social issues that matter to the community and the Bank. In addition, I manage our philanthropic donations and colleague volunteering programme. BFP: What is the best part about your job? WD: The job allows me to make a difference. It provides a unique opportunity to set up innovative projects that tackle poverty on the continent. Meeting the beneficiaries, speaking to them and hearing how such projects have impacted their lives and that of their families is the most rewarding experience. One of our most innovative projects is the Banking on Change project which promotes saving-led microfinance groups across Africa, Asia and Latin America. Seeing people who previously did not have the opportunity to save or access loans, now using these products to improve their lives, is remarkable. BFP: What has been your greatest challenge? WD: Development is multifaceted and finding one panacea is impossible. Therefore finding the right idea, the appropriate partners and willing community members to make projects sustainable is a big challenge. But once these factors are in place, it is amazing to see the radical transformation a small amount of money and effort can have on whole communities. BFP: What advice can you give others wanting to implement similar initiatives? WD: Look for innovative ideas. There are many problems out there and many solutions. There is no need to re-invent the wheel. To be different, you need to find the new ideas. To find these ideas, speak to the intended beneficiaries. Do not just read about the beneficiaries, go into the community, understand what their challenges really are and what they actually need. In my experience, they often have the solutions; it is our job to listen and understand these solutions, articulate them and turn them into models that can be replicated and expanded. To overcome my challenges, I have been very focused on what change I want to see happen in the community. Improving a person’s life depends on many factors and when you have a lot of passion for this, it is easy to get distracted which leads to trying many things. This ends up with little impact and it makes it difficult to understand what it is one has achieved. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do, where should they start? WD: Pick an area that you are most passionate about. Health, education, financial inclusion, etc. Meet people in the community, from children to old people. Old people tell you how their world was, giving you insights as to what was good. Middle-aged people tell you what their world is now and what they are doing to make it better. Children tell you how they see their world in the future. Read what many NGOs, academics and commentators have written about the specific area. There is a wealth of information already available containing many hidden ideas that are waiting to be explored further and scaled up. BFP: Finally, what do you hope to get out of being part of this community? WD: Business Fights Poverty is an amazing way of meeting like-minded people, people who have the passion of creating a world where all people can live the kind of lives they want to. Businesses have a unique role to play in fighting poverty. People work for businesses and businesses generate the wealth that is required to fight poverty effectively. I hope to share ideas with others and also hear what other businesses are doing to fight poverty. Editor&#8217;s Note: Thank you to Will Derban for taking the time to do this interview.

21024,Rich Cohen,https://businessfightspoverty.org/rich-cohen,"BFP: What do you do? RC: I am the founder and CEO of Distant Village Packaging. Founded in 2000, Distant Village designs and produces sustainable presentation packaging for small to mid-sized companies. Impressive packaging results from a brand-focused design approach and all-natural handmade packaging made by artisans from rural villages. As an example we make presentation packaging for fine chocolates, gourmet, tea, jewelry, organic clothing, spices, and much more. BFP: What is the best part about your job? RC: Everyone Wins! Clients get amazing brand-building packaging, and artisans have stable work while earning fair trade wages in their hometown communities. This eliminates urban sprawl while providing continuous economic support to artisan communities, and increased sales for brand owners of authentic sustainable products. BFP: What has been your greatest challenge? RC: Quality staffing. As we grow we have been challenged with staffing for sales and contract designers. We are seeking more growth in Europe. It is essential we have authentic and sincerely sustainable-minded people in our company, while also being talented in their professional capacity. At times, it is a challenge to find them, especially in foreign countries, like England and France, where we do not yet have an established network or presence. BFP: What advice can you give others who want to implement similar initiatives? RC: Be persistent yet flexible. I recommend keeping your ear to the ground to listen to clients and other important influencers to gain awareness of market needs. However it is important to remain flexible, while not compromising your mission and intentions. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do, where should they start? RC: Gain an understanding of the market needs and determine customer needs. Playing off the real estate mantra, I believe the three most important things in business are customers, customers, customers. BFP: Finally, what do you hope to get out of being part of this community? RC: I’m grateful for BFP creating this community of like-minded people. I hope to be part of the BFP community to help, serve, learn, and share. As socially-conscious businesses we share a common purpose. If there is a way to be of service to BFP and this community, please contact me. Editor&#8217;s Note: Thank you to Rich Cohen for taking the time to do this interview.

21027,Caroline Ashley,https://businessfightspoverty.org/caroline-ashley,"BFP: What do you do? CA: I am a freelance consultant focusing on promoting and facilitating inclusive business in developing countries. Inclusive business combines commercial return with strong development impact. At the moment I am working on two large projects (in addition to smaller bits of work): first, I am the Learning and Results Manager for the Business Innovation Facility, a 3-year DFID-funded pilot project which supports the development of inclusive business initiatives in five countries; and second, I perform the same role for a similar project funded by Sida, the Swedish Development agency, called Innovations Against Poverty, which will be launched on 28th April 2011. The main difference between these two projects is that the Business Innovation Facility provides advisory support to help companies overcome the constraints they face in launching their inclusive business initiatives, while the Innovations Against Poverty programme provides mainly financial assistance in the form of grants. In my role I focus on measuring and understanding the results of initiatives supported by these two facilities, and on drawing out lessons that are useful to other companies, or to donors for designing effective ways to facilitate inclusive business. I am developing a monitoring and evaluation framework for companies and for donors, to help them track their results. I also facilitate the exchange of ideas and insights, as editor of the online Practitioner’s Hub. BFP: What is the best part about your job? CA: I love the opportunity to work with such a wide range of inclusive business initiatives. I can be working with a peanut processing plant in Malawi one day, a business developing online education for Zambian schools the next, and then with a pilot to provide services to smallholder farmers in India through mobile phone technology. Talks with a start-up company backed by mixed funding from social and private sources can be followed by discussions with a major multinational company. This variety keeps the work interesting and practical. BFP: What challenges have you encountered? CA: The challenges faced by companies we support are a bit different to what I expected. I thought entrenched mindsets might be one, and the challenge of making business ‘inclusive’ would be the focus. Actually, people who come to us have plenty of vision and inspiration and the challenge that we help them with is often working out the business model, the revenue, pricing or distribution system, that will make it viable. For my own role, developing monitoring or results-tracking there are inevitable challenges: how to track results in a way that means something, actually tells us what difference a business makes to low-income people and why it succeeded (or didn’t), but in a way that is manageable for the company, feasible for us, and proportionate in the resources it uses. As we all know, monitoring can just be a drain. BFP: What are some of the “tricks of your trade”? CA: My approach to results-tracking is to make it useful to the company – it might still be time-consuming, but if it is useful in clarifying ‘what does success look like’ and ‘how will we know it when we see it’ then the effort is worth it. When they wrap up a morning’s workshop by saying ‘this will help us deliver results’ then it is no longer just abstract procedure. Another trick is in language: I talk to donors about ‘monitoring and evaluation’ and to companies about ‘results’. For me it’s also important to find a way of helping companies to tap into the experience of others and to learn from their peers in a forum that they trust and understand. It is surprisingly difficult for companies to share their experience with each other in an accessible way – case studies or presentations by the company are often seen as being too self-promotional; whereas reports produced by independent observers such as consultants, are more analytical but often too lengthy and overly technical. One of the objectives with the Business Innovation Facility Practitioner Hub is to overcome this problem by providing a very accessible platform for sharing and learning. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do, where should they start? CA: Inclusive business combines commercial and development thinking, so some experience in both business and development is of course useful. I don’t think it matters whether you start out in development and then start engaging with business, as I did, or vice versa. What matters is being open to both. People who do well in this field are those that thrive on working with lots of people from varied backgrounds and enjoy communicating with people on both sides of the conversation. BFP: Finally: what do you hope to get out of being part of this community? CA: I find it very useful to see what’s on other people’s radars, and to know what’s happening in other sectors. The range of topics that crop up on Business Fights Poverty reminds me that the niche I work in is only a small part of the business in development universe and that there is a lot going on elsewhere. I am looking forward to the knowledge zones that will be launched soon – I expect they will provide the opportunity to cover subjects in a lot more depth, which should be very interesting.

21030,Simon Berry,https://businessfightspoverty.org/simon-berry,"BFP: What do you do? SB: I am the Founder and a Director of ColaLife. ColaLife is working in developing countries to bring Coca-Cola, its bottlers and others together to open up Coca-Cola&#8217;s distribution channels to carry &#8216;social products&#8217; such as oral rehydration salts and zinc supplements to save children&#8217;s lives. We are currently working with SABMiller, UNICEF, local NGOs and others to undertake a trial of the ColaLife concept in Zambia which we hope to start before the end of 2011. BFP: What is the best part about your job? SB: I really enjoy building the cross-sector relationships necessary to make something like ColaLife happen. This involves being able to see the proposition from other people&#8217;s perspectives and building trusted relationships. This takes time and patience. I also enjoy the interaction with online supporters of ColaLife and reaping the benefits of that for the ColaLife cause. I currently work on a voluntary basis until we can get a funded pilot off the ground and my wife has also made that commitment. We&#8217;ve worked together for many years and I really enjoy working with her. BFP: What has been your greatest challenge? SB: Oh dear, there have been so many challenges along the way and we will face many more I am sure. It&#8217;s like an endurance race with no finish. You&#8217;ve just got to enjoy the race! BFP: What has been the secret of your success? SB: I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;d say we&#8217;d been &#8216;a success&#8217;. We&#8217;ve had successes and some have been very big ones &#8211; for example engagement from Coca-Cola, UNICEF and SABMiller in the project &#8211; but we are yet to test out the concept on the ground. It&#8217;s the injustice of child mortality levels in developing countries that drives us and ultimately our success will be measured in terms of our impact on this. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do, where should they start? SB: You just have to decide on your big hairy vision and then you&#8217;ve just got to take the first step without worrying too much about what your second step is. You just need to start doing something towards your vision. But you need to start carefully because you will need to bring others along with you. You don&#8217;t want to give the impression that you can do it alone, because you probably can&#8217;t. I started by setting up a Facebook Groupto share the ColaLife concept with others and engage them in making the concept better through challenge and contribution. The group also gave me the &#8216;power&#8217; I needed to engage with the very powerful stakeholders that we require. When I set up the Facebook Group, I had no idea that it was going to change my life in the way it has. I certainly didn&#8217;t think I was going have to give up my job to focus full-time on ColaLife! BFP: Finally, what do you hope to get out of being part of this community? SB: Business Fights Poverty was set up in 2008 around the same time that I started ColaLife as a Facebook Group. Without it I am not sure how I would have maintained an awareness of ColaLife within the big business community. It has been superb. As well as the online community, the events have been really useful and I applaud Business Fights Poverty and the big businesses involved for making them completely open and free. I believe this has been a real benefit to all involved. The remaining development issues we face are not going to be solved by any one sector or another, they are going to be solved (I believe) through innovative collaborations across sectors. An essential platform for this is non-exclusive collaborative networks and this is what Business Fights Poverty has provided.

21033,Matt Freeman,https://businessfightspoverty.org/matt-freeman,"BFP: What do you do? MF: I work for the Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN) in the Office of Investment and Partnership. GAIN was established in 2002 at a special session of the UN General Assembly on Children to address global malnutrition. Recently granted special status as an international organization, GAIN supports public-private partnerships to increase access to the missing nutrients in diets necessary for people, communities and economies to be stronger and healthier. GAIN invests in and works alongside more than 600 companies across 36 large-scale collaborations in more than 30 countries, already reaching more than 530 million people with nutritionally enhanced food products with the goal of reaching more than 1 billion people. My primary responsibility is to help drive public–private partnerships to achieve sustainable impact in reducing undernutrition. I help to align donor priorities with the core business interests of national and multinational companies to extend the reach and impact of development programs. BFP: What is the best part about your job? MF: The thing that I enjoy most about my job is the opportunity to be creative. Successful partnerships require a real alignment of interests, and often times you need to think outside the box to find that intersection. BFP: What has been your greatest challenge? MF: My biggest challenge has been maintaining momentum on partnership discussions. Most of the partnerships I’ve worked on, both during my time at USAID and now with GAIN, have required significant senior level buy-in. Even in nimble organizations that buy-in can take time – for governments and large corporations it can take much longer. Each partner works on a different timeline and it is important to manage expectations and keep all parties enthusiastic about the partnership. BFP: What advice can you give others facing a similar challenge? MF: The best advice that I can offer is to really take the time to understand the needs, expectations and fears of your partners. Look to find ways to elevate the conversation beyond the operational issues to the level of objectives. Once partners find common ground on the what, it’s much easier to get them focused on the how. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do, where should they start? MF: I think the first thing to do is start talking with stakeholders from each of the different communities. International development has become even more complex because of the diversity of new actors and each speaks their own unique language. To be able to draw these linkages, you have to act as a translator. Just as in learning a new language, immersion is the best method. That’s why Business Fights Poverty is such a great tool – it facilitates connections with other stakeholder groups that you might not otherwise have the opportunity to meet with. BFP: Finally, what do you hope to get out of being part of this community? MF: I hope to learn from experts across all different fields and to find new creative ways to link our work together. This is a tremendous moment in development – an opportunity to align new resources and new technologies like never before. I’m excited to be a part of it.

21036,Ida Horner,https://businessfightspoverty.org/ida-horner,"BFP: What do you do? IH: I run Ethnic Supplies, a social enterprise specialising in textiles, art and crafts from East Africa. Ethnic Supplies sources handmade handicrafts and fashion accessories from local suppliers that support women to be financially independent, or directly from established women&#8217;s groups in rural locations, and facilitates access for these products to wider markets. We purchase products from our selected suppliers and then distribute them into international markets through online sales via our web site, as well as identifying other retailers that could carry the products. Based in the UK, we work with women in Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania and Madagascar. I set up Ethnic Supplies after witnessing the extreme poverty in which some women live in my home country, Uganda. Seeing how hard these women were working to lift themselves out of poverty motivated me to find something that I, as an African woman, could do to support them which didn’t involve handouts. I believe in using business as a sustainable alternative to aid – I do not think creating dependency through aid is the best way forward. Based on work I have done in the past here in the UK, and my experience of the effects of the benefit system, I believe that creating access to work and income is by far the more effective route out of poverty. Business provides the opportunity for people to get paid for using the skills they have acquired, and to use this money to buy education, healthcare etc. BFP: What is the best part about your job? IH: To meet a woman who tells me that, because of a basket she made and sold to us she was able to put her child in school or put food on the table – that is the greatest reward. But I have also learnt an enormous amount from the women we work with. I have so much admiration for their resourcefulness and wonder if I would have been able to come up with the same coping strategies if I had been in their position. BFP: What has been your greatest challenge? IH: This is a very difficult market to access. The competition from India and China is huge – they are able to produce similar products at lower prices because of the high fixed costs in Africa. Even though input materials for these products are often free and labour costs are not high, the lack of infrastructure means that transport costs are very high &#8211; sometimes as much as half of landed costs are transport costs. So it becomes very difficult to price products competitively while covering input costs and ensuring a minimum return for our suppliers. Finding the right price point is critical – in my experience, even though more consumers care about ethical sourcing these days and claim to value the hand-made, authentic element of products, they are not necessarily prepared to pay a premium for such products. In the current economic climate things are even tougher than usual. BFP: What is the best way to overcome these challenges? IH: I think governments need to invest more in SMEs and make it easy for them to trade competitively. The infrastructure and environment with which business is conducted is critical to minimizing freight costs and production related costs. More or detailed information for consumers might help them make different choices as ultimately there is no such thing as cheap fashion. I am not quite sure how this would work or how realistic it is especially in terms of handicrafts and textile, but it has been suggested that consideration should be given to the protection of intellectual property. The idea is that China and India would not be able to copy designs from Africa and as such pricing the African artisans out of the market BFP: If someone wants to do what you do, where should they start? IH: You need to be absolutely sure that this is something you want to do – it requires total commitment. I would suggest that people take the time to really understand the issues, do a lot of reading, spend time in the communities you want to work with, speak to experts and network with other practitioners. A lot of people with very good intentions end up doing more harm than good due to a lack of research and understanding. BFP: Finally, what do you hope to get out of being part of this community? IH: BFP provides a great platform to share experiences with others and to learn from one another so that we’re not forever repeating the same mistakes. For me, BFP is a one-stop shop for all the information I need about what people are doing and what they’re discussing, and a great source for collaboration and opportunity. I get a lot out of BFP and would like to try and put a lot into it as well. Editor&#8217;s Note: Thank you to Ida Horner for taking the time to do this interview.

21039,Jon Samuel,https://businessfightspoverty.org/jon-samuel,"BFP: What do you do? JS: I am Head of Social Performance for Anglo American plc, one of the world’s largest mining companies. In this position I am responsible for managing the group’s social performance, including developing standards, policies and management systems; delivering training and guidance on social performance and socio-economic issues; and external engagement on the full range of human development issues. As part of this work I am helping to roll our Enterprise Development programme, Anglo American Zimele, which was established in 1989 in South Africa, to other emerging markets including Latin America. Anglo American Zimele has grown to become one of the most successful corporate enterprise development programmes in the world. Zimele creates and develops commercially viable and sustainable SMEs by providing empowerment opportunities for previously disadvantaged South Africans. Over the past 20 years, the initiative has become a catalyst for emerging black business, with the knock-on effect being sustainable job creation and socio-economic development in predominantly rural and peri-urban mining communities. The precise way we roll-out enterprise development varies according to local conditions. In Chile, for example, the team there has a strong focus on micro-credit for micro-enterprises because this was identified as a particular gap in small business support. I also lead the team responsible for the development and implementation of our Socio-Economic Assessment Toolbox (SEAT), which Anglo American has been using since 2003. It is the centerpiece of our stakeholder engagement, and the central repository of guidance on community relations issues within the company. BFP: What is the best part about your job? JS: One of the best things is the people I work with, both inside our company and in the partner organisations we work with. There are some incredibly committed people out there doing very interesting and important work. It is also hugely rewarding to be working in such a multicultural environment and very satisfying to be able to influence the development impact of a large multinational company. BFP: What has been your greatest “business and development” challenge? JS: Expectations at community and government level around the role that business should play are very high and growing. Taking such a broad-based view of business’s role in community development is a relatively new approach. When fully incorporated into the business it affects a wide range of functions not traditionally concerned with social development, such as procurement and HR. While there has been a very strong commitment within Anglo Americanto getting those high external expectations built into the company’s management systems in a realistic and sustainable way, we have had to invest time and money in figuring out the best ways to achieve this. BFP: What advice can you give others facing similar challenges? JS: First, be realistic in your expectations. Be clear about what you hope to achieve and report internally on what has been achieved using the existing management reporting channels where possible. It is also crucial to get support for your initiative from leadership by showing how activities support the organisation’s overall strategy. Finally, in a company like ours, budgets in this area are often substantial ($111 million in 2010), and it is crucial to apply the same criteria in respect of budget review and approval, project management, performance appraisal and accountability for delivery as you would for any other part of the business. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do – where do they start? JS: There are currently probably four main routes into this kind of job: internal transfer from another professional function inside your organisation or another business; move across from one of the NGOs that engage with business; move across from a government department which shares a common agenda; or transfer from an advisory or research capacity, eg from a consultancy or university research unit. Because this is still an emerging function there is no well-established graduate/post -graduate recruitment route yet.

21049,Alison Griffith,https://businessfightspoverty.org/alison-griffith,"BFP: What do you do? AG: I lead the work on markets and private sector engagement for Practical Action, an international NGO set up by E. F. Schumacher, a radical economist in the 60s. I’m based at Head Office, we have seven regional and country offices in Africa, S Asia and Latin American. My job involves helping the organisation to develop approaches that tap into the potential of market systems and the private sector to achieve greater impact for those living in poverty. BFP: What is the best part about your job? AG:We have really inspiring country teams and that gives me an opportunity to work with very varied and challenging contexts from Zimbabwe to Darfur, Northern Kenya to post Tsunami Asia and post conflict Nepal etc. With these country teams we have been able to really contribute quite significantly to emerging areas of thinking, for example around market system approaches. Our work and our learning is based on the realities of where we’re working and they are very inspiring people to work with. It’s a real privilege to do something that is so grounded but at the same time able to be influential. I’ve had great opportunities to learn with colleagues who are really at the front end of development. Some of my role is about helping them to analyse their work and other parts of my role is about what we can add to international discussions and work that is going on. BFP: What have been your greatest challenges? AG: When I joined Practical Action 10 years ago the really big challenge was how to achieve scale. The typical approaches of the time were developing Micro and Small Enterprises (MSE’s) and they were successful in part, in small pockets, but they only ever seemed to reach a couple of thousand people here and there and replication of those kinds of successes was really hard to achieve. That was the big challenge and reflecting on those challenges with my colleagues, with the international team led us to think about what approaches we should be taking. We have been on this journey over the last 9 years and have put quite a lot of our energy and resources into developing an approach which we have called Participatory Market System Developmentwhich is both about understanding a market system and engaging key actors in a specific system. It could be agriculture, energy, dairy, vegetables or whatever systems are important to the poor. We work with those actors &#8211; large, small, public, private etc – and enable them to work out what needs to be done to make that system work more effectively and help them to figure out what the leverage points are. This has been a really big shift for us from being providers to facilitators of processes and it has been a massive challenge. It’s changing the way development works and challenging a lot of established practices. A recent challenge is that large scale private companies would like NGOS like us to be providers of goods and services to the poor, but it’s not realistic for international NGO like us to do that on a sustainable basis. BFP: How have you overcome these challenges?/ What advice, would you give to others? AG: To achieve scale and ensure our actions have a sustainable impact, we build the capacity of market system actors to be able to respond to changes, address a challenge and explore and exploit opportunities. We are interested in how you create systemic change and how you build capacity within that system to respond to an ever changing environment. We have learnt not to make assumptions on where/ what the problems are, if we did this we could easily miss something that is very critical. Typically that might be an issue in the enabling environment or a social norm that is going to affect how people will actually behave and how they will respond to change. Our approach is to first do a quick analysis ourselves and then we work out who the key players are and bring those players together. We always look to hook people into the process by responding to something that is an issue for them. At this stage our facilitation skills really need to kick in, because it is about helping them to work through what the key solutions are and who will be doing what. Our role is to look at how we support that process, and what we can do that will enable those ideas and initiatives to work. We have to be careful not to jump in too much, too soon. That is one of the biggest things we have learnt, although this can be hard when you have donors who want fixed outcomes set out 3 or 5 years in advance. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do, where should they start? AG: I started in the agriculture sector in UK, moved to the livestock sector in Kenya, and then went into fair trade in food. I got disillusioned about how ineffective a lot of aid money was and from there I guess it was only a small jump for me into broader market development. In those days a masters and some experience in international development was really important. Today things have changed and continue to change at a fast pace. Now I think there is a really important cross-over between those in the private sector and those in development. Increasingly internships are becoming a good way to gain experience. I also think there could be more secondments between organisations in the different sectors. It’s also helpful to learn about what others are doing in this space through online networks such as Business Fights Poverty and SEEP. For me, what makes an individual attractive and increases their employment prospects is really to do with their skills around attitude. Things like learning, flexibility and building relationships. Which on the face of it sounds general but those are critically important skills if you’re going to be in development and particularly in the area of markets and the private sector. BFP: Finally: what do you hope to get out of being part of the BFP community? AG: I genuinely believe that it is a really exciting time to be in development. The influences and the players are changing and there is massive potential that also brings huge challenges. It is going to be critical to learn from each other and have a really open attitude and approach to tackle global poverty. Business Fights Poverty is a brilliant space to be able to do that in. It’s very open, with fantastic diversity and yet still manages to be pretty focused. Editor&#8217;s Note: Thank you to Alison Griffith for taking the time to do this interview.

21052,Lise Melvin,https://businessfightspoverty.org/lise-melvin,"BFP: What do you do? LM: I have worked with the Better Cotton Initiative (BCI) since 2006 and am currently the Executive Director of this multi-stakeholder not-for-profit initiative. A voluntary members association, BCI’s goal is to transform the global cotton industry, creating greater sustainability for the farmers and workers who grow cotton, greater sustainability for the environment and greater sustainability for the industry as a whole. BFP: What is the best part about your job? LM: There are two aspects that I find particularly exciting about working for BCI. The first is undoubtedly the people. I’m surrounded by incredibly motivated, talented people that are truly committed to creating a more sustainable cotton industry. A lot of businesses and organisations have been accused of “green-washing” and being more concerned with illusion than impact, more focused on sound-bites than sustainability. But BCI members are – by and large – a remarkably dedicated bunch. They get that it’s not just a question of changing the packaging or sticking a label on a product. They understand that it’s about having impact on the ground and changing how they work with their supply chain. And they understand that we’re all in this for the long term. The other thing that I love about working for BCI is the innovative nature of what we’re trying to do. We’ve done our best to design sustainability into our own process. So rather than focus on a specific standard that then gets certified, we’ve put the focus on continuous improvement. So we have a list of minimum production criteria, but beyond that, it is less important at what level you “come into” the BCI programme, and more important that you commit to regular improvement. Also, we’re focused on changing the system. Not one part, or only in one region, but the way cotton is produced globally. As you can imagine, this is quite a challenge. And because nobody has all the answers for how to do this successfully, we’re experimenting with how to scale up, while maintaining a credible and meaningful approach in doing so. BFP: What have been your greatest challenges? LM: I think the greatest challenge has been – and remains – the issue of systemic change. Initially, it was the pressure to focus on one aspect (i.e., only the environmental aspects of cotton production, or the social, or the economic ones) &#8211; BCI focuses on all three pillars of sustainability. After all, we’re competing for attention and funding with others who often focus on only one aspect, so their value proposition can be that much simpler and more forceful. Now that we are more established and have successfully seen Better Cotton produced in four countries, our challenge is scaling up – bringing improvement in opportunities to more farmers and change to the entire system. It requires a tremendous balancing act. Balancing the needs of the various actors in the supply chain – from the farmer to the retailer. Balancing the creation of demand with production of supply, all the while trying to incentivise taking action and moving forward. And balancing short-term expectations with long-term goals. BFP: How have you overcome these challenges? What advice can you give others facing similar obstacles? LM: I think that what has brought us this far is our clear focus on our ultimate goal and our willingness to question what we are doing and adapt as necessary. While we are consistent in our destination, we try to remain open-minded about the best route to get there. With something as large and complex as the global cotton supply chain, it is a continuous learning process. It is necessary to have confidence in the face of “not-knowing”, since there is a lot of pressure to have all the answers. But that is neither realistic nor possible. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do, where should they start? LM: If you mean being Executive Director of an ambitious non-profit-organisation, I’d say start with getting lots of sleep! Once things get moving, you’ll rarely have the chance again…. I think it definitely helps to have experience in working with multi-stakeholder cooperation, and to have an appreciation and understanding of different cultures. At the end of the day, no matter what the idea is, it is people that have to believe in your vision, people that you have to work with, and people that have to change their behaviour. Listening to people attentively, understanding what makes people tick and how they think is a critical skill-set. BFP: Finally, what do you hope to get out of being part of the BFP community? LM: One of BCI’s main goals – creating better lives for cotton farmers and workers – is all about fighting poverty. So it makes perfect sense to connect with Business Fights Poverty and its network of dedicated professionals. Furthermore, I am very conscious of the fact that, if BCI is to succeed in its mission to create a more sustainable cotton industry, ultimately it also has to make good financial sense. Although, for some of the Least Developed Countries, additional public financial support will continue to be needed, the fundamentals of what we do need to make commercial sense. If we are to avoid being a flash-in-the-pan development project, the Better Cotton Initiative has to be understood by businesses, its practices supported by businesses, and – finally – its ideas internalised by businesses. Fortunately, we are off to a very good start. Members like IKEA, H&amp;M, Marks &amp; Spencer, adidas and Levi Strauss &amp; Co have been extremely supportive of BCI, investing large amounts in farmer training and making significant strides in better understanding and engaging their supply chains. And we’re getting inquiries every week from retailers and suppliers wanting to join, so I think it is safe to say that businesses are becoming aware that investing in sustainability (including economic sustainability for those in poverty) makes good sense. Indeed, as the global community is becoming all too aware, it’s madness not to think sustainably; ultimately, it’s self-defeating. Finally, like Business Fights Poverty, BCI is all about acting collectively: sharing knowledge, learning from each other, and moving together towards a common goal. And like BFP, BCI relies on a diverse group of organisations, from donors and NGOs to businesses and learning institutions.

21055,Tamiru Woubbie,https://businessfightspoverty.org/tamiru-woubbie,"BFP: What do you do? TW: I am an advocacy specialist at the Ethiopian Chamber of Commerce &amp; Sectoral Associations (ECCSA). I am part of a team working to engage the government with advocacy issues that concern the private sector. The government and the private sector have appreciated that working together is advantageous to both of them. To this end a memorandum of understanding has been signed between the representatives of the government and the private sector. Accordingly the private sector is to identify business bottlenecks and present them to the attention of relevant government ministries. Such high level consultative forums are to be held, at federal, regional and city levels, several times within a year. There will also be one National Business Consultative Conference, which will be chaired by the Prime Minister of the country. BFP: What is the best part about your job? TW: The best part about my work is that I am part of a team that is doing its level best to empower the private sector that is believed to immensely contribute to the fight against poverty through the creation of wealth, employment and additional source of government revenue. BFP: What has been your greatest challenge? TW: The greatest challenge in this endeavour has been that you may not get immediate results, while there may be anticipated impacts of your activities. Also challenging has been prioritizing issues of advocacy, because of conflicts of interests across the constituencies. Your domestic producers may want you to push for a policy decision in favor of banning the export of skin and hides, so that exporters of leather articles could add more value to their products. Likewise domestic textile and garment producers would be happy if the export of cotton is not allowed for there is high domestic demand for such raw materials at the domestic market. Yet there are strong arguments for the export of raw materials as well. Another example: High import tax rates on some products could help some domestic producers while low duty tax rates will result in lowering selling prices of imported goods. All these show that these seemingly ‘contradicting’ interests are signals for us to be very careful in handling such issues and we have to take into account the interests of the national economy to strike a balance between these varying interests. BFP: How have you overcome these challenges? What has been the secret of your success? TW: In addition to all our activities we introduced a motto of “Buy Ethiopian” to the Chamber’s annual International Trade Fairs to increase the awareness level of domestic consumers, with a view to promoting local products. Domestic industries produce consumer products that have both backward and forward linkages. They also contribute employment for quite a number of people, many of whom also happen to be the only breadwinner in an average family size of about 7 people. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do, where should they start? TW: First of all they need to like what they do. They also need to believe that it is through creating wealth that one can do away with poverty. We, at the Chamber believe that government and the private sector need to appreciate that working together is an imperative to developing the economy. BFP: What do you hope to get out of being part of the BFP community? TW: What I like most about it is the very title of this community, “Business Fights Poverty”. I really like it very much. Apart from that, it has brought together wonderful people of different capabilities, from all walks of life. I am very proud and privileged to be a member of this wonderful gathering. I have witnessed that there are different events, although I haven’t participated in any one of them so far and that’s what I am planning next.

21104,Rosario Londono,https://businessfightspoverty.org/rosario-londono,"BFP: What do you do? LR: I am currently part of a multi-disciplinary/multi-sectorial team that is co-creating the transformation of the world’s agricultural eco-system. We are incubating and scaling-large-scale, business-led social and environmental innovation prototypes that we believe will significantly increase the WELL-BEING of ALL. We bring to the table an “uncommon” team of partners that are all committed to co-creating and collaborating a bigger “whole” for everyone, instead of each stakeholder coming to the table with their own agenda and a vision for what is in it for them. It takes a different mind-set and definitely stretches everyone’s comfort zone… And it is so worth it. It may sound cliché and the truth is that to be able to transform something outside of us we first have to be willing transform ourselves. BFP: What is the best part about your job? LR: This is a hard one to answer. There are so many things I love about my ‘job’ I don’t even feel like it’s a job- if I had to pick just one, I would say it is the people I work with and work for. I am constantly learning and growing from and with them. I have the privilege of working with people not only from different nationalities, cultures and backgrounds, but also who place high value on empathy, respect and empowerment. Most of the times our work interactions are not about proving who is right or more intelligent, and more so about supporting each other, in a way that it allows each one to perform their best. BFP: What have been your greatest challenges? LR: Creating my own career path and definition of success. Quite early in my “career” I came to the realization that I didn’t want to follow the pre-set career paths offered in my organization and yet I felt incredibly passionate about my work and the endless possibilities I saw. I knew I wanted to stay and work at the Bank and that I wanted to innovate and venture into new areas and projects. At times, I have felt like an outsider, misunderstood and confused whether I have made the right choice. At other times I have been seen as the troublemaker and a bit of a rebel. All of these experiences have offered me plenty of material and opportunities to question my thinking, “tame” my ego and need to be right and/or feel acknowledged by others. In the recent future, many of the projects I co-created and incubated have started to show tangible, positive results and sometimes that’s what it takes for some sceptics of social innovation to become a bit more curious on what it is that is being proposed. BFP: How have you overcome these challenges? / What advice, would you give to others? LR: Finding and creating an outside network of like-minded people has been instrumental; as well as always finding the right mentor to guide me and keep me honest. As I mentioned before, my definition of success is to love what I do and work with and for people that support me in showing-up as the best version of myself. The times I have woken-up feeling like I don’t want to get up to engage in work, I know its time for me to move on, and I have. My advice to others: Create your own team- these are people who will keep you honest and true to yourself. That will help you uncover your blind-spots with kindness and celebrate with you when you overcome them. Work hard- and smart. Know thyself! Know in which environment and with what type of people you thrive, produce your best and work with flow. I personally have stopped trying to work with a certain type of personality. I have learned and grown personally a great deal when I had worked for them, and I certainly do not show-up as my best under their supervision. Learn to execute more efficiently and be prepared to deliver the best you can. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do, where should they start? LR: I really do believe that finding out as early as possible what you love is the best advice I can give anyone. Find that something that gives you more energy than it takes away- whatever it is that you don’t need caffeine to sustain you and be committed to put in the hard work. Then go find people who are already doing what you would like to be doing, find a way to connect with them and learn from them as much as possible. BFP: Finally, what do you hope to get out of being part of the BFP community? LR:There is great deal of excitement and awe that is felt when standing in the unknown and facing what feels like an insurmountable challenge or what so many of us have called an intractable problem. The BFP offers the best platform I know to allow people from all backgrounds to come together to take-on the “impossible”. My hope is to continue to learn from each other and co-create solutions together. Editor&#8217;s Note: Thank you to Rosario Londono for taking the time to do this interview.

21144,Zunaed Rabbani,https://businessfightspoverty.org/zunaed-rabbani,"BFP: What do you do? ZR: I am the Executive Director of Market Development Forum (MDF), a practitioners’ network for development professionals working on Private Sector Development, in particular, in the field of market development/ making markets work for the poor (M4P). It is primarily a membership-based association, open to development organizations and projects (and donor agencies from this year), which thrives on knowledge-sharing based on in-person interaction and field-level activities. So what I do is basically whip up all my energy and drive people within organizations to share knowledge. Although manned by only two people (including myself), we facilitated 23 events in the last 23 months (with zero money outside our administration and personnel cost), reaching a direct audience of more than 1,100 people from private, public and development sector. In addition to that, my task is to put on multiple hats – from communications to HR issues; from finance and administration to contract management because in the end it is a full-fledged registered organization and is governed by an Executive Committee, consisting of top management representatives of seven INGOs. BFP: What is the best part about your job? ZR: Being at the heart of information and contacts; and being able to facilitate events that benefit hundreds of practitioners. Although may not be an ideal situation from an organization’s perspective, but since it is a very small team led by me, I am the dot that connects many practitioners. At the same time, it’s also like working in multiple organizations because a big part of what I do, and this is something I absolutely love about my job, is to call on MDF members and find out their plans and interest areas over a cup of coffee. New plans excite me, as much as the coffee. BFP: What have been your greatest challenges? ZR: As far as my current job is concerned, I have found out that no matter how enthusiastic people may sound about knowledge-sharing at first, to many, it is a tick in the box to comply with donors’ requirement. This may not be true at the thought-level in global a space, but at the local level, knowledge sharing may not come top in the priority list. And I do not blame them for this because of a systematic flaw –there is no immediate, tangible benefit of knowledge-sharing, for which practitioners, who are already bogged down into their project work, prioritize it differently. BFP: How have you overcome these challenges? What advice, would you give to others? ZR: And this is where personal drive and personal connection comes into play. Keep nagging – that’s my motto! On a one-to-one basis, I primarily deal with the likes of Country Directors, but simultaneously, I try to encourage staff from different layers within an organization and walk them through the process. To bring about a systematic change, I am also bringing donor agencies into the sharing-sessions where development practitioners would bare out their true feelings which may not get translated upwards through the usual formal channels. But that’s more in the country-context. Now I am planning to reach out to a global audience through my blogs and communities like BFP on these pressing issues &#8211; issues that are faced by implementers at the field-level. I am more than happy to share my experiences, but I don’t usually advise people on looking at my career path as an ideal one since that’s a road full of trials and errors. But I guess that’s what the 20s are for! Now that I am a tad bit wiser and in my early 30s, I would strongly suggest budding professionals to have a solid foundation at first which could come from an academic program or/and getting ‘out there’, meeting people and being open to new (and conflicting) ideas. And no matter how many years of experience you have got, you can try what is one of my new year’s resolutions for this year – to put indicators to the career path. We plan outputs, outcomes, frameworks, methods/models for our projects/business ideas; I think we should do the same for our professional lives, in our own way. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do, where should they start? ZR: From the very beginning I knew what I didn’t want to do, but I was not totally convinced on what I want to do, partly because there is a varied range of things I wanted (and still want) to take up. But it is very important to know what you are good at. For me, I have got a mix of business and international development, both academically and professionally, backed up by decent organizing and communication skills. I am glad that my current job appreciates all these and encourages me to facilitate initiatives that can reach out to a wider audience. So, either you could find your niche based on your core competencies, or plan way ahead to be where you want to be in 10 years’ time – but that’s easier said than done! BFP: Finally; what do you hope to get out of being part of the BFP community? ZR: Positive energy, to start with, and a billion of ideas to let my brain go all berserk. I make the best use of my potential when I am around progressive and proactive change-makers and I think BFP has successfully been able to congregate the best of minds across the globe. Here, I hope to learn from others and offer my two cents as well in order to shape up the development paradigm. And I am also keen on exploring experimental and bold initiatives that match my work space. Editor&#8217;s Note: Thank you to Zunaed Rabbani for taking the time to do this interview.

21232,David Laurel,https://businessfightspoverty.org/david-laurel,"BFP: What do you do? DL: Coming from a seven year stint in supply chain in 2004, my most&#8230; Nestle Philippines was when my superior advised me to visit communities in different cities to look for opportunities for partnerships. One of the rural communities I was &#8216;lucky&#8217; to visit was a small district in south Luzon. As I approached the village, I was abruptly cautioned and asked to explain my purpose for being there. I promptly identified myself and said that I was looking for opportunities to help the community through a partnership. “No thank you” was the brusque response, “we don’t need any more help!” He irritably showed me his &#8216;home&#8217; and said, “As you see I have half a roof! We were promised water, no water from the tap, no livelihood!” All the houses were half finished. The &#8216;beneficiaries&#8217; had no means of at least making ends meet. I left quite humbled. I found out that families were relocated from the railways in Manila, and the funds raised for providing a new life for the informal settlers did not meet the projected targets. BFP: What is the best part about your job? DL: Nestle’s community development focuses on the communities surrounding the factory sites. So it makes sense to create shared value with these communities particularly for socio-economic monitoring for continuity. The “Cut and Sew” program is such a CSV and it has become one of the most effective business models for fighting poverty. It does not rely on funds from single events that are of limited effect. The business model is ‘wired’ into the company’s value chain. It is also for this reason of being wired that it is best to do pilot implementations that do not impede the value chain. These pilots are great opportunities for fine tuning and learning for the beneficiaries and the partners. This is a highlight of my work. BFP: What have been your greatest challenges? DL: In my experience, the toughest challenge to implementing programmes in a community of the very poor is the &#8216;mind trap&#8217;. At times there can be a negative attitude, e.g. dole out mentality, or sometimes you hear &#8220;we were meant to be poor&#8221;; and as mentioned above, the resentment and resistance to change that has built up due to past experiences. BFP: How have you overcome these challenges? / What advice, would you give to others? / What is the secret of your success? DL: The best way to change those attitudes is to show them successes. We let them listen to our community leader who climbed out of poverty as a farmer’s wife, to what she is today, a full sized entrepreneur who now provides jobs for thirty housewives. She has evolved, from beneficiary to benefactor. We make this triumph the community’s overarching objective, that they all become benefactors one day. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do, where should they start? DL: First of all, do an internal Value Chain analysis in your company as a host company. Identify an area or areas of your value chain that you may open to external partners. Second, after getting the best partner/partners, agree with your colleagues and partners on the community where you will implement a PILOT, choose wisely. It would be prudent to do a needs analysis survey in that chosen community. In terms of location, the closer the community is to your company’s office or factory would be helpful in the long term for ease in monitoring and in the short term for &#8216;presence&#8217;. In the communities I worked with there is an overriding need to have presence, e.g. employee volunteers go regularly to visit, teach, etc. I cannot overstate the importance of rapport as a basic requisite to the success of community engagements. Third, set up your metrics which will depend on micromanaging and tracking of events that make a difference in the socio-economics. Lastly, values formation is non-negotiable and not prioritizing the building of values will lead to program failure and the damage the community. BFP: Finally; what do you hope to get out of being part of the BFP community? DL: I want to learn from the experts, so BFP would be a good place to do this. I am sure there are many powerful resources out there reading the posts, who have yet to share their “master plan” against poverty. I eagerly await this. I would like to thank those who have emailed me directly for interesting and enlightening discussions. Editor&#8217;s Note: Thank you to David Laurel for taking the time to do this interview.

21273,Chad Bolick,https://businessfightspoverty.org/chad-bolick,"CB: I lead global partnership development efforts at FSG with a focus on one of our core programs: the Shared Value Initiative. As we explore and outline the contours of the emergent field of shared value, we have to engage a wide range of constituencies—companies, nonprofits, government, and more. Exploring shared opportunities and challenges across these diverse partners illuminates partnership opportunities that support competitiveness and business ROI while simultaneously solving a social or environmental challenge. BFP: What is the best part about your job? CB: Our shared value field-building and advocacy efforts have included developing a network of consulting affiliates trained on shared value strategy. The Consulting Affiliate Network now counts more than 50 firms from 30 countries. I am continually inspired by the work these firms are leading, as well as by the chance to explore opportunities in such a wide range of markets. The Network provides us with the unique ability to zoom in on local shared value knowledge, as well as zoom out for a more complete picture across all Affiliates and field-building partners. BFP: What have been your greatest challenges? CB: Two things come to mind: 1) a steep learning curve on how to build and advance a movement; and 2) identifying and nurturing shared value champions. BFP: How have you overcome these challenges? What advice, would you give to others? CB: On the learning curve, our approach has been to invest time and resources in prototyping field-building activities, fail and adapt quickly, and move on. In many ways it’s a nod to the fact that the Shared Value Initiative team is based in San Francisco and Boston—both hubs for knowledge, learning, and innovation. For example, we tried to launch an executive education course on shared value in 2013. While companies were interested, a groundswell of interest actually came from the nonprofit sector. Rather than start with an executive education for corporate practitioners, we altered course and are testing a shared value affinity group for large international NGOs. On identifying champions, it was easy at the outset to default to shared value conversations with regular contacts in corporate philanthropy and CSR. Yet the real opportunity with shared value lies in using core business assets and expertise to create new products and services, unlock value chain productivity, and enable healthy business environments. We have found that finding and nurturing these champions has taken us outside our comfort zone with traditional constituencies – and that has had a tremendous impact on our learning. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do, where should they start? CB: A common thread throughout my career—from the American Chamber of Commerce in Vietnam to BSR to FSG—has been a passion for finding compelling ways to engage business in solving societal problems. For the past decade, leading this work within consulting firms as a non-consultant has been a fascinating perch from which to explore strategic partnerships that aren’t immediately apparent to consultants who move from project to project. I would encourage anyone interested in thinking about strategic partnerships to actively build and cultivate their professional network from the very beginning. I have a list of roughly 50 “influencers” who I actively stay in touch with regardless of whether they are a client or not. BFP: Finally, what do you hope to get out of being part of the BFP community? CB: Access to and partnership with a group of idealists and practitioners who punch holes in our early concepts and ensure we are learning from others and not wasting time reinventing the proverbial wheel.

21304,Ekanath Khatiwada,https://businessfightspoverty.org/ekanath-khatiwada,"BFP: What do you do? EK: I am one of the fortunate professionals who have had the opportunity to work in various contexts, in both Eastern and Southern Africa and the Asia region. I have provided advisory services to various pro–poor rural agribusiness enterprises; public private partnership initiatives in South Sudan, Zambia, and Nepal. I have contributed and shared private sector and entrepreneurship development models in national and international policy forums and publications. I am currently an independent consultant working on market development, present assignments include; a Making Markets Work for the Poor (M4P) feasibility study of renewable energy in Zambia for the SNV Zambia renewable Energy programme and a post –milk for school pilot business model development for WFP, Zambia. BFP: What is the best part about your job? EK: I have always been happy in my roles wherever I worked. One stand out break though in my professional life was when I was working for a special pro-poor entrepreneurship piloted by the UNDP’s South Asia Poverty Alleviation Programme (SAPAP). I had adopted various innovative approaches (kind investment, community insurance/ safety net package, community led infrastructure and inputs out put market for the rural poor) to address the real ultra poor issues into the programme fold. The approach and principles adopted during the pilot; were later adopted by the Government of Nepal as the cornerstone of their local development policy. This was the best part of my professional life so far &#8211; that I was able to make a bigger impact to the ultra poor community. BFP: What have been your greatest challenges? EK: I came from the real BOP family, initially I had to struggle a lot to find my feet. I do not regret my combat, because all those struggles made me stronger and a more independent thinker. As far as my professional career, at times I have found myself in a difficult position because of my differing perspective of poverty, from my own life experience, with other practitioners/ colleagues coming from the better off world and understanding the issues differently. Sometimes it has been a challenge for me to convince others of ideas /innovations that I believed would really work. BFP: How have you overcome these challenges? What advice, would you give to others? EK: Positive attitude, consistent efforts and an appreciative inquiry process are the key tools that helped me to overcome my challenges. I never gave up! Because of this I have had global exposure to poverty reduction tools and best practice models like local economic development, social mobilization and community development, market development, inclusive business model, making market for the poor and so on and begin to understating the issues how other practitioner better understand the issues than my narrow perspective. Now I able to blend my thoughts with the other best practice model- which is really making me proud!!! So far for the BFP community; business is a powerful tool to address many more poverty issues in the society, therefore I would advise to exchange each other’s knowledge, experiences (both breakthroughs and breakdowns) that faced by us at the various unique context and situation. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do, where should they start? EK: I should be proud if some one wanted to do what I am doing. It means I am doing the right thing. First of all I would share my lessons and where I had difficulties on what I am doing and what really works. If some on succeed on my model I would count it is another bark though that how we are making different collectively. Therefore I always document field level experiences and share with the likeminded forums and publication. Based on my experiences of value chain development, M4P and market development approaches, I would not advise other practitioners to start the market development initiative with out complete understanding of the current market system as a whole. BFP: Finally; what do you hope to get out of being part of the BFP community? EK: BFP has generated a wealth of knowledge, various pertinent issues on private sector development, inclusive business and market access for the poor (M4P). It s becoming a knowledge hub around the above issues. Currently I am actively participating on various discussions and making the best use of my potential and my field level practice gained in my 15 years of professional experience. At the same time I am also learning so many best practice models from other colleagues within the BFP network. By being a part of the BFP community , I feel able to contribute to shape the various innovative business model that can work in this changing and dynamic business world.

21349,Daryl Burnaby,https://businessfightspoverty.org/daryl-burnaby,"BFP: What do you do? DB: The team that I work in is called Global Health Programs and we are a team of 10 people who are dedicated to helping further GSK initiatives focused on access to healthcare in the most underserved communities. Two key strategic themes for GSK are innovation and access. ‘Innovation’ is all about inventing the next wave of medicines and healthcare and vaccines, for example the new malaria vaccine that has just recently been in the news. ‘Access’ is how do you make sure that the products that you have are accessible to people at the right price and actually get to the people that need them the most, rather than just a smaller proportion of people who are either are able to afford them, or who are located in cities, or live in more developed countries. That’s what we do, as a team we work alongside the business to help deliver one of its key objectives – improving access to healthcare. For GSK it is not about having corporate social responsibility programmes and separately carrying out your business, it is about being a responsible business &#8211; bringing the two together.

DB: I’ve been in my current role for a couple of years and what is exciting to see, is that we are moving from programme set up to a stage where we are beginning to see the impact of our initiatives. A year ago we could say, ‘this program has trained 500 people in this country’ and now what I am seeing in reports is amazing. There is already a difference in the mortality and the morbidity rates in a number of communities. For example, in Nepal we have a program, based in the most western part of the country. In this community we have seen a change in mortality rates for mothers and children from over 350 down to about 50 over the project period. We can’t say that is due to our work alone, but what we have delivered is the training of health workers who work with women and children on their health issues. So to actually see those changes in health and mortality rates is fabulous. Moving to that place where we you can really start to see the impact of the work we are doing- that is one of the highlights of my work. BFP: What have been your greatest challenges? DB: I face my greatest challenges when trying to make sure that we are consistent in what we do. We are currently managing projects in 35 of the 49 least developed countries, there are some very worthy projects and ideas that people have, that don’t meet our focus areas, so it just doesn’t make strategic sense to invest in them. Even though they are great projects. For example, a manager could approach me explaining, there is a huge need in Myanmar for hygiene and sanitation and there is this great organization that we could use our 20% profit reinvestment commitment to support it. Perhaps fund their school hygiene and sanitation programme. And despite it being a great programme and all the work going into it, we have to say no we can’t support it. This is not an easy thing to do and it is the most challenging part of my role. In order to be focused on what we are doing we sometimes have to say ‘no’ to things. We have a very clear sense of where our strengths are and where we can provide the greatest support, in the end it always makes the most sense to stick to that. BFP: How do you overcome those challenges? What advice would you give to others? DB: There are ways to overcome this. Whilst our 20% profit reinvestment approach has a clear strategic remit of what we can invest in, there are other local funds that can be used for worthwhile programmes that fall out of those parameters There are contributions that can be made that don’t involve money. At GSK there is a scheme called ‘PULSE’ where employees can take up to 6 months to volunteer for an NGO in the UK or overseas. We also have ‘Orange Day’ where people can take a day from work to volunteer their time to an NGO of their choice. All 100,000 employees have an opportunity to take that one day a year to go and work for an organisation they want to support. BFP: So if someone wanted to do what you do, where should they start? What career route did you take? DB: I’ve had quite an unusual career path, I did a science degree and PhD because I loved science when I was at school. I joined GSK as a graduate trainee because although I wasn’t clear on what exactly I wanted to do, I did know that I wanted to be part of an organisation that used science to make a positive impact. In total I’ve been at GSK for fifteen years, I did three years as a graduate trainee in finance and then I moved into more commercial roles for five years. On the GSK graduate scheme I had placements all around the organisation. This gave me a good understanding of how the whole organisation comes together. A pivotal point in my career is when I took part in PULSE, the employee volunteering scheme, where you can go overseas and work for an NGO. I went to Sri Lanka and worked for a disability organisation for six months. In Sri Lanka I got to experience first hand some of the issues and challenges that you see working at an NGO. It gave me real insight into how distant that reality is from the funding which is signed off in London. This experience confirmed for me what I wanted to do more than anything, so I came back to the UK and I got into the area of the business that I am in now. BFP: Finally, what do you hope to get of being part of the BFP community? DB: BFP helps with connectivity &#8211; keeping your eyes and ears open and being aware of how things are developing. It’s important to hear others’ ideas and initiatives and reach out to make connections to other organisations. It can also be helpful for getting an idea of those we could work with in the future. Partners who would be able to add to what we are doing as an organisation and vice versa. BFP can help us to get our message out there. That was one of the things that we wanted to do when GSK CEO Andrew Witty announced the 20% reinvestment approach. We wanted others to be able hear about it. So multinationals working in least developed countries could learn about the approach we are taking at GSK and consider adopting a similar type of model in their business. I think it’s really important to get out of your own organisation to hear what other people are doing as well as sharing with them what you are currently working on &#8211; learning from each other.

21506,Harvey Koh,https://businessfightspoverty.org/harvey-koh,"BFP: What do you do? HK: I co-lead our Monitor Inclusive Markets unit in Mumbai. In India, we work on developing and scaling inclusive business models, working with companies, funders, investors, governments and civil society, in sectors including housing, water and sanitation. We also conduct and publish research on cross-cutting global issues in inclusive business. BFP: What is the best part about your job? HK: Figuring out how to get business models to really work on the ground, working hand-in-hand with entrepreneurs and other actors over years, not weeks or months. It doesn’t matter how elegant something looks on paper, it’s only worth something if we can make it happen, and ideally at large scale. BFP: What do you see as the greatest challenge? HK: Getting resources allocated against the right needs. We put the spotlight on the problem of the ‘pioneer gap’ a few years ago: there’s money chasing shiny new innovations at one end, and proven, growing enterprises at the other, and not enough focused on the tough work of validating and preparing models to really scale. And, as we’re about to talk about in our new report “Beyond the Pioneer: Getting Inclusive Industries to Scale” (published 7th April), there is also often a need for what we call ‘industry facilitation’ to help resolve scaling barriers that firms can’t fix on their own, and there’s still too little recognition of this need and resources for this work. BFP: How can these challenges be overcome? HK: We need to do a better job of bridging the silos we operate in. Those of us who work at the coalface in India and Africa need to find a common understanding with those who control a lot of the capital, many of whom are still in North America and Europe – this will likely change, but not overnight. Funders and investors need to start seeing that they have intersecting interests too, and really work on seeing how they can reinforce what each other is doing. We are doing our bit to help by writing and speaking about what we see on the ground, for a global audience, but there’s only so much we can do. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do – where do they start? HK: I started out in strategy consulting with Monitor working mainly with big multinationals on key strategic decisions, but also government. After seven years, I was ready for a change and decided to go work with The One Foundation, a pioneering European venture philanthropy fund, and then New Philanthropy Capital, a nonprofit research and advisory firm. I then spent four years setting up and running a new venture philanthropy fund at the Private Equity Foundation in London, which is where I realized that business growth and social impact were both much harder to achieve than they seemed. But the call of the developing world, and inclusive business, was too strong to resist, so three years ago I decided to head out to India with Monitor’s Inclusive Markets unit. I think my background in consulting definitely helps me operate at this frontier that we call inclusive business, but I’ve also benefited hugely from the learning that happened when I was in the nonprofit world, about the complexities of social change and the systems that are implicated in that change, and about the broader set of skills that are needed to engage with those systems. BFP: Finally, What do you hope to get out of being part of the Business Fights Poverty community? HK: I hope that Business Fights Poverty can really help us break down these silos that I was talking about. Being where we are in Mumbai, there are limits to how much we can engage with donors agencies in Europe, or corporates in the US, so it is really valuable to be part of a global community that is deliberately multi-sectoral and committed to the potential of inclusive business.

21543,Ainsley Butler,https://businessfightspoverty.org/ainsley-butler,"What do you do? I recently joined TFO Canada, which is an NGO that confronts the challenge of global poverty by promoting sustainable economic development through export information, advice and contact. I manage Canadian market access services for countries in the Americas, Africa and Asia. My team’s mandate is to increase exports from developing countries to Canada. In parallel, I work on local content management as a principle consultant to Building Markets. I’m developing a mining venture, to bring together government, industry and small business in Africa to increase the economic impact of local content. What is the best part about your job? I am very inspired by the local entrepreneurs I get to meet. Creating jobs and more importantly a sustainable future for others is one of the most amazing ways that people can help each other. What has been your greatest challenge? Nine years ago, when I first started working on sustainability projects that aimed to increase local content, it was extremely difficult to convince people that this was an effective way of fighting poverty. Having perseverance and patience to change perceptions, together with my colleagues, has lead to several successful projects, while local content is increasingly recognized as a good business practice. How have you overcome these challenges? The most important thing is to love what you do and be unrelenting in your work. Having evidence of impact is very important – that includes robust data, but also comes from experience. I have learned so much from entrepreneurs about the importance of learning about different cultures and how to build a better environment in specific communities. Working under some difficult circumstances has taught me a lot about the resilience of the human spirit and that the best way to create a better tomorrow is by helping create jobs where they are needed the most. If someone wants to do what you do – where do they start? Finding your niche is key. People with a passion for international development should contact an NGO or government agency to find out about internships and full time positions. Offering your services for temporary voluntary work is often a good way to get exposure and experience that can lead to other opportunities. Finally, What do you hope to get out of being part of the BFP community? I hope I can provide support and insight to other professionals in the community about local content. It’s really interesting to learn about international business experience in development directly from the source – understanding how to scale what works and fail fast is really important. This information is especially valuable when it comes from practitioners willing to share their experiences on BFP.

21610,Alyssa Rivera,https://businessfightspoverty.org/alyssa-rivera,"BFP: What do you do? AR: I work at Endeva, where our aim is to further inclusive business through research, knowledge transfer, and consulting. We also help other actors, like donors or governments, understand how they can best support companies working in inclusive business. I have been with Endeva since 2011, and have worked on a variety of projects – for example, GIZ’s BoP Sector Dialogue reports on energy, pharmaceuticals, and agribusiness, a survey of the status of inclusive business in sub-Saharan Africa for UNDP AFIM, and various workshops and other events. BFP: What is the best part about your job? AR: The best part of my job is learning about and enabling business models that are actively driving development in emerging and developing markets. I enjoy interacting with companies directly. Seeing research become reality – through consulting entrepreneurs on how to create or improve their inclusive business model or hearing feedback on how a report or webinar we hosted has been useful in their ventures – is incredibly rewarding. Working on a variety of projects is also a fantastic part of my work. For example, we are currently researching the replication of inclusive business models, have recently released a whitepaper on private schooling in the developing world, and are gearing up for our first Inclusive Business eLab with the BoP Learning Labs, WBCSD, and Business Fights Poverty. This diversity in subject matter and ways of reaching our target groups means my work is exciting and intellectually stimulating. BFP: What has been your greatest challenge? AR: There are a lot of challenges in inclusive business, but the one that is currently on my mind is the fact that a lot of these models remain small. About a decade after the notion of inclusive business began to take off, we’re seeing definite success stories. Now it’s time to get a grasp on what works and replicate it. Difficulties in scaling and replicating are limiting inclusive business from reaching its full potential. BFP: How have you overcome these challenges? AR: Planning, partnering, and sharing are important. I’ve been part of a team at Endeva who has been studying the replication topic for over a year now, with outputs being a toolbox for businesses detailing various replication strategies they can consider, and an upcoming report with BMZ on how development partners can best support replicating businesses. We identified 3 major factors that are hindering replication for businesses – lack of appropriate finance, lack of necessary information and knowledge, and difficulty finding the right partners and HR. Our recommendations include innovative financial products that reduce risk for investors, supporting the dissemination of successful models, and training second movers. Endeva continuously leverages knowledge transfer to share cutting-edge research in our field through our reports, consulting, and other ventures. For example, the upcoming Inclusive Business eLab is a good way for businesses to get an intensive introduction to inclusive business models. They can dive into ‘our’ world with access to experts and the latest knowledge of what works and what doesn’t. Part of that initiative includes the opportunity to get one-on-one coaching from experts from Endeva and our partners to kick-start their model following the course. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do – where do they start? AR: I learned about Endeva through my Masters program. I was doing an M.A. in Economics when Christina Gradl, one of the company’s co-founders, was brought in as a guest lecturer for a Development Economics seminar. She presented Endeva’s work in microinsurance with Allianz, and the business-based approach to fighting poverty resonated with me. Higher education opens a lot of doors – as well as pursuing interesting opportunities as they come by. People like it when others are genuinely interested in their work – I really enjoy conversation with people in my field, whether at events, online, or in a seminar hall, and it often happens that we have common areas of interest or can even collaborate on a project. Networking and an open attitude can lead to great partnerships! BFP: Finally, What do you hope to get out of being part of the BFP community? AR: I am looking forward to being an active part of the ever-growing inclusive business community. BFP offers a great opportunity to connect to people no matter where they are, allowing them to create networks and work as part of a larger ecosystem. I’m looking forward to new connections and working together with the community! Editor&#8217;s Note: Thank you to Alyssa Rivera for taking the time to do this interview.

21640,Yasmina Zaidman,https://businessfightspoverty.org/yasmina-zaidman,"BFP: What do you do? YZ: I work at Acumen to develop creative partnerships with institutions that share our vision for a more inclusive and sustainable world. This involves working with a range of corporations and foundations to develop partnerships that help scale social enterprises, expand leadership development, and spread ideas that offer new approaches to tackling global poverty. BFP: What is the best part about your job/project? YZ: There are many things I enjoy about my work, whether it’s helping to raise awareness about the critical role that social enterprises play in solving global challenges, or working with our partners to find ways to leverage their strengths. But I think my favorite part of my job is finding people inside large organizations that are as passionate about radical change and impact as any of the social enterprises that we work with, and finding ways to work with them towards meaningful systemic change. BFP: What has been your greatest challenge? YZ: Big organizations and small entrepreneurial ones work in different ways, at different time scales, and with vastly different resources. Part of my job is to bridge the gap between corporations and social enterprises by helping each side see, and respect the realities, of the other. BFP: How have you overcome these challenges? / What has been the secret of your success? / What advice can you give others ? YZ: I am always experimenting with ways to overcome these challenges, but I find that the most important thing is to recognize the humanity of everyone we work with, from the low-income consumer that has been underserved or exploited, to the corporate executive who is driving change in their own organization. I try to bring people together, through a shared vision, through storytelling, and through face-to-face interaction, that can lead to powerful new partnerships. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do – where do they start? YZ: My route has gone through corporate environmental sustainability, as a researcher and consultant, into the social entrepreneurship space, through business school, and into social enterprise and patient capital investing. My function, whether it was as a consultant, a portfolio manager, a communications director, or now partnerships director, has always been less important than the purpose or objective of my work. I advise people to pursue a path that stretches them, brings them into contact with great people, and allows them to leverage their strengths to have an impact. That kind of career can lead you down a non-linear but really rewarding path. BFP: Finally, What do you hope to get out of being part of the BFP community? YZ: Being part of this community has exposed me to the ideas of peers who share the view that business can be a catalyst for change, has helped us find new potential partners, and will hopefully help us share what we are learning from our partnership work. We are proud to be partnering with BFP to extract lessons and amplify the impact of our Technical Assistance Initiative, which you can read more about here.

21708,Marjorie Brans,https://businessfightspoverty.org/marjorie-brans,"BFP: What do you do? MB: As Director of the School for Social Enterpreneurs Ontario (SSEO), I am responsible for overall management of the School, which is dedicated to supporting and developing social entrepreneurs and intrapreneurs and their respective ventures. A big part of the job is mobilizing the business community to contribute its tremendous technical skills and commercial experience to students’ triple bottom line initiatives. BFP: What is the best part about your job/project? MB: For sure, it’s that I get to be involved in so many different social and environmental change projects all at one time. For each cohort of fellows at SSEO, we have twenty students representing twenty big dreams. I love reviewing applications to our programs—it’s like being at a fantasy dessert buffet where it’s ok to pile your plate high with all the tasty treats that catch your eye. We’ve had students working on everything from increasing access to legal justice, to reducing carbon emissions, to creating a dating website for people living with a disability. The range of issues is vast, but the students are all united by a common passion to stand up for something they believe in and to make terrific personal sacrifices to create the change they envision. BFP: What has been your greatest challenge? MB: SSEO helps people take an idea to reality, so we inherently deal with a lot of start-ups. The thing is, SSEO itself is a start-up. Although the School for Social Entrepreneurs, founded in London, has been around since 1997, SSEO launched in Canada only in the summer of 2012. As such, we are going through all the same start-up growing pains as everyone else. Working here is like traveling through a maze in a house of mirrors. I often help students on problems and see SSEO’s reflection staring back at me. Naturally, I find it much easier to see potential solutions to the student’s problem, because I’m looking at it from an objective point of view. But when it comes to the issues of SSEO itself, the path never seems so simple. Start-ups are incredibly challenging because you have to do everything for the first time and it’s usually not entirely clear where you’re headed. I try to feel my way through slowly, trusting my instincts, and not getting too flustered when I hit a dead end. BFP: How have you overcome these challenges? / What has been the secret of your success? / What advice can you give others? MB: The one thing I keep coming back to over and over is the concept of unlearning. In any innovative project, I can’t help but bring all my cultural and social and personal baggage with me on the journey. The thing is, that baggage is often a barrier to seeing the full range of new possibilities. Unlearning is about bringing a beginner’s mind to the situation, questioning every single assumption about how things need to work. My three-year-old is a great model for me. He asks questions like why he can’t eat macaroni and cheese for breakfast. The thing is, he’s right. There’s no inherent reason that he can’t; culturally, however, we don’t. To be innovative, I’ve got to think like a three-year-old and unlearn all the assumptions I bring to the initiatives. I try to do that every day, and SSEO is a place that intrinsically fosters an unlearning environment. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do – where do they start? MB: Hah! I have no idea how one would replicate the path I took here. It involved so many surprising twists and turns! If I had any advice, it would be to reject the mentality that you’ve got to check off any particular boxes to be “successful.” I’ve seen a lot of people get paralyzed about taking a step they really want to take, because society or Dad or someone else tells them they are supposed to be doing something else. I spent the first 20+ years of my life trying to follow the expectations of people around me—they told me they knew what one needed to do to be happy. Once I finally summoned the courage to strike out on my own, I realized that I had wasted all those years living someone else’s dream. In my experience, happiness is a by-product of listening to the quietest voice in your heart. BFP: Finally, What do you hope to get out of being part of the BFP community? MB: I’m thrilled to connect to people who share this vision of a new type of economy, one in which we don’t have to rob Peter to pay Paul. The zero-sum economy is so last millennium… Editor&#8217;s Note: Thank you to Marjorie Brans for taking the time to do this interview. We&#8217;re always looking out for members to feature.

21754,Dave Prescott,https://businessfightspoverty.org/dave-prescott,"BFP: What do you do? DP: At an international level I do research and writing projects, promoting the role of business as a partner in development. A lot of my work has been in the extractive sector, with organisations such as ICMM and EITI, and I&#8217;ve recently been working with TPI on a report that was launched at the GPEDC High Level Meeting in Mexico. I also work at a local level to promote sustainability and carbon reduction, of which more below. BFP: What is the best part about your job/project? DP: Definitely the people – this field attracts people from such an interesting range of backgrounds and experience, all with these high ideals and loads of integrity. The recent project with TPI was just a joy to work on because of the team of people involved. And it&#8217;s the first time I&#8217;ve worked with a former quantum physicist&#8230; I also enjoy the challenge of trying to extract the complex ideas in people&#8217;s heads and attempting to transmit them clearly in words, and increasingly with visuals as well. It&#8217;s such a multi-disciplinary field and the attention to detail on the design of reports can be just as important as the substance of the text. For example, on the TPI project the designer was seriously patient with me as we went through draft after draft trying to convey the concept of resonant frequencies as a metaphor for effective partnership. But I think it was worth the effort! BFP: What has been your greatest challenge DP: There&#8217;s quite a long and increasingly diffuse causal chain involved between report production and poverty alleviation, so I sometimes wonder exactly what impact I&#8217;m having. But I guess this is the same in all fields of international development. BFP: How have you overcome these challenges? / What advice can you give others ? DP: In attempt to shorten the causal chain I have recently started complementing my international projects with more work at a very local level here in my rural corner of the UK. It&#8217;s been very interesting to discover that the challenges of fuel poverty, local governance capacity, intermittent political will and mistrust across sectors are all reminiscent of the kind of issues I&#8217;m writing about in developing countries. I like the balance of the two types of work. I believe there is a role for people to keep joining up the dots at an international level, to keep making the arguments for integration and collaboration in new and creative ways. I also believe that working at a local level is a good way to &#8216;keep it real&#8217; – when you are talking to people up the road about things like renewable energy or community resilience you have to cut to the chase very quickly or you will lose their attention. Ultimately though, if I had to distil my advice to someone looking to work in this sphere, I would ask them to remember that everyone is making it up as they go along. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do – where do they start? DP: My route was somewhat unconventional, though I guess most of the people on this site will have had unconventional routes. I started off at the International Business Leaders Forum &#8211; a real baptism of fire for a first job – and then went freelance in 2004, after which time I have worked with a series of people who seem to like my writing style. For me, the single thing that has driven me throughout my career is a deep sense that the way the world organises its affairs is absurd, but that with just a few course corrections, just a bit of cultural tinkering, we could set things on a much more equitable, fulfilling and creative basis. When I find people who share this view, I do my best to hang out with them and see what emerges. BFP: Finally, what do you hope to get out of being part of the BFP community? DP: Two things. I am really interested in the rapid growth of this community, it seems like an incredibly well informed and well connected group of people. So I hope to find others who are offering the same mix of international and local work so that we can compare notes. And, secondly, when I consider the gloomy trends that characterise the world at the moment, I find the sheer range and quality of discussions that are underway on this site to be a powerful antidote. So I hope to find more hope. Editor&#8217;s Note: Thank you to Dave Prescott for taking the time to do this interview. We&#8217;re always looking out for members to feature.

21811,Mike Wisheart,https://businessfightspoverty.org/mike-wisheart,"BFP: What do you do? MW: It&#8217;s a role with a lot of variety. One aspect is leading our advocacy work within corporate partnerships which includes seeking opportunities for joint advocacy with partner companies in areas of mutual interest. For example, there could be opportunities for advocacy with a company or business association in line with our Child Health Now Campaign ( http://www.wvi.org/childhealthnow). I also work on policy development in relation to the role of business in development. Over the last few months I&#8217;ve been focused on a fascinating study on cross-sector partnerships, business and post-2015 in which we interviewed over 30 organisations including governments, businesses, and civil society organisations. The first discussion paper based on this study has been published and can be found here and there will soon be an online discussion on the proposed recommendations for targets in the post-2015 framework related to cross-sector partnerships. Please get involved! BFP: What is the best part about your job/project? MW: I enjoy working in the many spaces where businesses and NGOs interact. I firmly believe that collaboration between sectors of society is critical if we are going to overcome the multiple complex challenges facing our world. Having the opportunity to work in this important collaboration space is a privilege. I particularly enjoy working with our country offices as they look to design and implement specific advocacy engagements related to the role of business in development and cross-sector collaboration. BFP: What has been your greatest challenge and how have you overcome them? MW: Business, governments and CSOs tend to use different language and have different drivers and motivations. A significant challenge is to move beyond differences in positions and to dig deeper to find areas of common interest. This often takes perseverance and patience. However, it is exciting to find these collaboration opportunities where we can work together across sectors, including in advocacy, and opens up possibilities for more sustainable solutions addressing issues of poverty and justice. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do – where do they start? MW: Experience of working in more than one sector of society is a great foundation for cross-sector collaboration and I&#8217;ve been fortunate to work in the private sector and in civil society organisations. On the advocacy side, I have found it advantageous to have worked in development programmes engaging with similar issues in communities to those which I am now involved in seeking policy solutions for. BFP: Finally, What do you hope to get out of being part of the BFP community? MW: Its a great way to engage with people who are thinking through similar issues. I was fortunate to be part of the panel for an online discussion on BFP a couple of months ago on systematically engaging business as a partner in development. Great fun trying to keep up with range of thoughts and views being raised! Editor&#8217;s Note: Thank you to Mike Wisheart for taking the time to do this interview.

BFP: What has been your greatest challenge? HD: The greatest challenge is getting people to accept change. I feel pretty blessed to work in a company full of people who lean forward into the unknown – without that, programmes like Net-Works wouldn&#8217;t have been born. But even in such a game-changing culture, it&#8217;s hard to get people to adopt new behaviours – to share ideas early, and engage others in the early stages of a project. How have you overcome these challenges? / What has been the secret of your success? / What advice can you give others? HD: Strong relationships and trust are a big part of how we do what we do in the Co-innovation team. We are asking people to radicalize the way they operate, and in order to do that, you have to speak with credibility (past successes), and build a team of supporters that trust the vision. Armed with that group of early advocates, it&#8217;s then up to you to help change the mindset of the rest of the community before you ask them to adopt any type of behavior change. People need to see the value of what you&#8217;re asking, and get behind the vision first. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do – where do they start? HD: Well, my route was a bit circuitous, to say the least. My first career was in the entertainment industry, working on the executive teams at film studios (MGM, Sony). I worked with writers, artists, directors and producers to tell the best stories we could. Having always been an avid environmentalist (I grew up in Northern California, and tree hugging is a rite of passage), I got pretty involved in Sony&#8217;s sustainability community, which was still growing. I realised quickly how much impact corporate entities could have by building environmental purpose into the core of their strategy, and decided to get my MBA and enter the broader corporate world – as a sustainability champion. But on this winding road, I&#8217;ve always stayed true to the belief that compelling stories can change even the most hardened of hearts, and tried to hone my native abilities to help meet that goal. If I were to give advice, it would be to look deep – understand what you do really well, then get better at it. Discover and develop your personal expertise, and then find a way to use that brilliant ability to deliver change according to your passion. I sometimes speak with people who believe that a deep passion to save the world is enough to get a great job, but I always ask them &#8220;What expertise do you have to bring to the table? How can you bring value to this fight?&#8221; BFP: Finally, What do you hope to get out of being part of the BFP community? HD: The BFP community is filled with people who are changing the world. I hope to learn from their experience, build relationships with people who inspire me to be better, and develop connections with organisations interested in Co-innovating with Interface.

22032,Lanre Akinola,https://businessfightspoverty.org/meet-lanre-akinola-editor-financial-times-member-of-the-week,"BFP: What do you do? LA: I am the Editor of This Is Africa, a title from the Financial Times. We cover Africa in a global context, with a broad focus on business, development and policy. BFP: What is the best part about your job/project? LA: While our focus is Africa, we approach it with a global mindset. This means connecting the dots of how global trends are shaping realities on the ground, and how trends in Africa are and will impact the globe. The continent finds itself in a unique position to fundamentally redefine its global role in the 21st century, and understanding the drivers behind this is fascinating. BFP: What has been your greatest challenge? LA: The media industry is in the midst of the most profound disruption it has ever seen. The digital revolution is challenging almost every aspect of the business with no easy or apparent answers. Managing the transition from a print culture towards a digitally driven business has not just been my greatest personal challenge, but for the industry as a whole. BFP: How have you overcome these challenges? / What has been the secret of your success? / What advice can you give others ? LA: We’re not there yet, but resilience and perseverance are key. Do not get demoralized when things do not work, and learn from mistakes! BFP: If someone wants to do what you do – where do they start? LA: Get as much experience as possible. Sadly, the (unpaid) internship is still the most viable route into the industry. This was the route I took. Beyond this, my suggestions are: Get out there: There are many free events that present strong networking opportunities for anyone trying to get into journalism. Apply yourself: Journalism thrives on ideas and self-starters. Don’t wait to be told what to do; come up with your own ideas and do not be afraid to put them forward. Do not take it personal if they are rejected, being resilient is an important part of learning the dynamics of the industry. It is almost inevitable that you will hear a lot of “no” at the beginning of your career. Don’t be shy: The old saying “if you don’t ask, you don’t get” will serve you well in journalism. It is not an industry that rewards shyness. Get out there and ask! BFP: Finally, What do you hope to get out of being part of the BFP community? LA: Few things are more important in life than learning, and through engagement with the community I hope to build on my knowledge and experience.

22186,Rob Stevens,https://businessfightspoverty.org/meet-rob-stevens,"BFP: What do you do? RS: I am Head of UK Operations at ClimateCare and I work as part of a small but dedicated team from the UK office in Oxford. ClimateCare is the natural partner for companies, governments or institutions wishing to tackle climate and development issues including cutting carbon emissions, tackling poverty and improving health. Whether you simply want to offset unavoidable carbon emissions through a project that protects the environment and improves lives, or invest in new projects and local businesses, we help organisations make investment decisions that fit with their business needs and produce the CSR outcomes they seek. In my role, I consult closely with sector-leading businesses to design bespoke programmes that achieve their sustainability aims. This can involve anything from helping them identify which one of a range of existing climate and development projects to support, right through to developing bespoke projects from scratch or managing global programmes. Whatever the detail of the approach, our focus is always on delivering measurable outcomes and channeling investment to deliver the maximum benefit for people and the environment. BFP: What is the best part of your job/project? RS: There are many great aspects to my work. Firstly, I work with a brilliant team of results focused professionals, who are passionate about tackling climate change and delivering low-carbon development. Secondly, I am fortunate to engage with motivated and forward thinking businesses, NGOs and entrepreneurs who feel the same way and are working tirelessly towards the same goals. Tackling what are some of the world’s most pressing issues is all about partnership, collaboration and finding new ways to work, and it’s rewarding to help these partnerships form and provide platforms for sharing best practice. Thirdly, seeing families and communities benefitting in their day to day lives from having safe water, or a clean cookstove which makes it easier for them to breathe in their own homes, or an irrigation system which makes their water go further and improves their diet and increases their household income. BFP: What has been your greatest challenge? RS: Our goal is to attract private finance to tackle climate change and deliver low-carbon development. We have proven it can be done &#8211; our greatest challenge now is to stimulate more businesses and investors to follow the lead of our existing partners and step up to the mark &#8211; taking measurable action to tackle climate change and support sustainable development. Once they do, our model speaks for itself &#8211; it simply makes sense to tackle these challenges together both financially, and on the ground. We want to present a ‘call to action’ to businesses. Tackling climate change is now on the business agenda and is widely accepted as being a core business issue. More and more businesses are taking action to measure and reduce their carbon footprints; some are going further by also taking responsibility for offsetting remaining carbon. They can maximize the value of this action by choosing to offset through climate and development projects. That way their action not only addresses their environmental target, but contributes to other business objectives, such as empowering communities and building resilience in supply chains, sustainably managing water and resource use and building social value in developing markets. BFP: How are you overcoming this challenge? RS: We are lucky enough to have long term partnerships with many of our clients, spanning more than a decade. Together we have already made a huge impact, cutting 16.5 million tonnes of CO2 and improving the lives of 6 million people. The prompt to shout more about what we do came when we won a Queen’s Award for Enterprise earlier this year. Acknowledgement by such a well-respected and mainstream business award encouraged us to share our message and call for new business partners. Our first job is to help organisations step back and see how to integrate environmental and sustainable development activity and to understand the enormous potential of this integrated approach. The reasons why companies are looking to deliver climate with development programmes vary from organisation to organisation. For example, with the Co-operative, we are bringing safe water to their tea farmer communities – for them it&#8217;s about taking responsibility for emissions and at the same time, improving the lives of people in their supply chain. For others, it’s about bringing partners together to scale up the impact they can have. For example we recently bought together a private sector investor Macquarie Bank with the Swedish Energy Agency to support a new CookClean stove project that is cutting carbon, empowering entrepreneurs and improving the health of families in Ghana. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do &#8211; where do they start? RS: Actually, you can currently apply for a job with ClimateCare – we are recruiting for a number of positions in our Oxford office. You can see more on our website and read a bit about what it’s really like to work at ClimateCare in this blog by our intern, Sam. Most of the team are specialists in their areas and have worked at a senior level in large corporates before choosing to join ClimateCare. What we all have in common is the passion to use our business experience to tackle the most important issues of our time. We are a very focused and professional team; at the same time ClimateCare is a fantastic and inspiring place to work &#8211; for a small team we have a big impact! BFP: What do you hope to get out of being part of the BFP community? RS: The BFP community is a community of partnerships, collaboration and inspiration. It shows not only what is possible, but how it is possible. I hope to learn, share and be inspired, and of course, meet some potential new partners!

22230,Tara Lundy,https://businessfightspoverty.org/tara-lundy,"BFP: What do you do? TL: Vestergaard is an international company dedicated to improving the health of vulnerable people, most of whom live in developing countries. Our game-changing solutions contribute to a healthier, more sustainable planet by fighting malaria, HIV/AIDS, diarrheal diseases and neglected tropical diseases. I work within the water business unit at Vestergaard, managing a variety of responsibilities related to the development and deployment of our LifeStraw® products. These products transform microbiologically contaminated water into safe drinking water. More specifically, I manage training, data collection and implementation of our field projects in Kenya including LifeStraw® Carbon for Water and Follow the Liters. The LifeStraw® Carbon for Water Program uses carbon financing to provide access to safe drinking water to more than 4 million Kenyans. Our Follow the Liters cause marketing campaign provides one school child in Africa clean water for an entire school year for every LifeStraw® purchased by a consumer. I also develop training curriculums for our products and advise on program implementation for partners. I assist in the production of our technical marketing documents, and in the implementation of product field trials. BFP: What is the best part about your job/project? TL: The best part of my job is being able to make the direct connection between the products we develop and the end users who benefit from them. I have the unique opportunity to work with our R&amp;D, supply chain, marketing and sales teams, and to also spend time implementing programs where I go to households, schools, clinics, etc and interact with the users of our products and beneficiaries of our programs. I am able to see the direct, often life-saving impact that our products and programs are making on the lives of individuals in the developing world. BFP: What has been your greatest challenge? TL: One of Vestergaard’s core values is to be an innovative challenger. This often means pushing the boundaries with our programs or products and coming up with new ways of doing business in the global health and development sector. To that end, we have been at the forefront of developing and testing new business models, an example of which is the LifeStraw® Carbon for Water Program. This program was the first to issue carbon credits based on the provision of safe water, and thus the first to demonstrate that climate finance can support safe water projects at scale. Yet, being a first has its challenges: carbon finance is complicated, especially when it comes to implementing water programs. There is a rigorous monitoring and reporting process that encompasses annual data collection, independent auditing, and additional verifications and reviews. And, because we were the first, a lot of these processes have been refined as the industry has collectively gained experience. We have had to work closely with our auditors and the Gold Standard Foundation to develop best practices. This has required a lot of time, energy and adaptation. Much of what we have learned has formed the basis of new guidance that has been issued for this niche industry. There is always more that can be done, but the challenge is to find the right balance between program activities, monitoring processes, and financial sustainability. BFP: How have you overcome these challenges? / What has been the secret of your success? / What advice can you give others ? TL: I think part of our success is having an attitude of adaptability and openness to improvement. In the LifeStraw® Carbon for Water Program, every time we do education and training, create surveys, collect data, we are making changes in an effort to refine our practices and respond to new recommendations or lessons learned. We implemented smart-phone based electronic inventory and reporting systems for our service centers and central warehouse; we have worked with external reviewers to refine our survey practices; we have even reached beyond the direct scope of the program and worked in schools and health clinics. We have also leveraged the information and experience gained from this program for the general LifeStraw® business. For example, we use feedback from the program to inform design process of next generation products, we leverage our infrastructure to field test new products, and we use our staff to train other NGOs in the region. We know there is always something new to learn from the field, so we are constantly collecting data on our products and refining them or creating new designs. I think that’s what keeps us moving forward as a successful business. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do – where do they start? TL: I think companies with some form of social enterprise model will be the most sustainable in the future. So my advice: join one or start one! It takes a comprehensive understanding on the ground of the problems you are trying to solve and the context, but like anything, with hard work, you’ll gain that knowledge. My own path started by working with more traditional NGOs and bilateral aid agencies. I also have a dual masters degree in public health and in business. In my education, I wanted to focus on that intersection: how can businesses be effective in the global health arena. The rest was a bit of luck and networking: I met my boss who was a previous graduate of my masters program, talked to her about Vestergaard, and then got hired. Since I have been at Vestergaard, it’s been a steep learning curve, a lot of hard work, and quite a bit of fun. BFP: Finally, What do you hope to get out of being part of the BFP community? TL: Inspiration. The BFP community is filled with incredibly talented and passionate individuals who are providing amazing ideas and innovations. I like the thought-provoking editorials, interesting products, and unique perspectives. I think being part of the BFP community is an excellent way to connect with counterparts doing similar work all over the world and to learn from their experiences and hopefully apply them to my own work.

22251,Michael Ronan Nique,https://businessfightspoverty.org/michael-ronan-nique,"BFP: What do you do? MRN: I work as the Innovation Manager for the GSMA Mobile Enabled Community Services (MECS) programme from our London headquarters office. Briefly, the GSMA represents the interest of the mobile operators and our dedicated arm, GSMA Mobile for Development, focuses on driving commercial mobile services for underserved populations in emerging markets. By bringing together the GSMA mobile operators members, the wider mobile industry and the development community, we identify opportunities for social, economic and environmental impact and stimulate the development of scalable mobile services across multiple sectors (finance, agriculture, health, female empowerment and disaster response). Funded by the Department for International Development (DFID), the MECS Programme&#8217;s objective is to improve access to basic energy and water services using mobile technologies, services and infrastructure. As mobile connectivity extends beyond the reach of the electricity grid and central water utilities in many markets, more people often have better access to mobile networks than to electricity and clean water. The GSMA believes that the size and the reach of the mobile industry&#8217;s infrastructure, mobile operators&#8217; distribution channels, Machine to Machine (M2M) connectivity, mobile payments and services offer innovative pathways to achieve reliable energy access and improved water access for underserved communities. Our work includes financing innovation, knowledge-sharing and convening, technical assistance and advisory services. In my role, I lead Innovation and Research Activities for the MECS programme. This includes advising our stakeholders (mobile operators, investors, entrepreneurs and NGOs) on the role of mobile in the energy, water andsanitation sectors. We monitor and disseminate content related to technology and business model innovations in these sectors. I also spend time in the field meeting innovators and communities to uncover insights on the usage and impact of mobile technologies. BFP: What is the best part about your job/project? MRN: Working in this role for the GSMA MECS programme is exciting in many respects. Firstly, spending time in the field, at the contact point between service providers and the populations benefiting from these solutions is invaluable. I think this is a fundamental part of the work: in order to better understand the context of mobile usage and its potential to solve some of the most important problems, you need to spend time on the field, meet people, observe habits and gather evidence. My role at the GSMA MECS team provides ample opportunity to undertake this crucial work. Secondly, our position within the industry is quite unique as we are working at the forefront of innovation in the mobile, energy and water sectors. The rapid development of mobile infrastructure, services and ownership of mobile devices is now enabling the development of innovative business models which would have been unthinkable even ten years ago. By working with and supporting innovators leveraging mobile technologies, we catch a glimpse of what the future of energy, water and sanitation services in emerging markets will be &#8211; and the building block necessary to support solutions at scale. Finally, the MECS team itself. We are a team of 6 people based on 3 continents (with offices in London, Nairobi and Delhi). We&#8217;re still lean and agile, despite the geographical dislocation, and our different backgrounds, expertise and cultures are complementary. Also, being part of the wider GSMA Mobile for Development team which now counts more than 70 people, allows us to draw on the knowledge of experts in the technology and development sectors on a daily basis. BFP: What has been your greatest challenge? Some of the big challenges we&#8217;re facing are about how we can best support emerging mobile-enabled models in a sector that is still nascent and how we can foster more partnerships between the stakeholders in our ecosystem. Information is often missing on the value of market-based approaches to serve lower income customers and how profitable and catalytic such mobile-enabled ventures could be. For example, as the GSMA, our main stakeholders are our member mobile operators and their core business is to provide voice and data services to their customers. However, once you&#8217;re working out of these core business activities, you need to find and explain what would be the value for them to get involved, through partnerships and/or direct services, in the energy or water sectors. What we outline during our regional working groups and through our public reports, is that mobile operators have a catalysing role to play to support solutions adoption and growth because of their strong local presence and brand. It would also benefit their business activities if they enable their mobile subscribers to have a better local access to clean energy and clean water. BFP: How have you overcome these challenges? /What advice can you give others? I think that by providing the right kind of evidence and support to our stakeholders and by convening the right people and organisations around the table, we are optimizing our chances of success in our goal to facilitate the growth of this MECS ecosystem. When I refer to providing the right kind of evidence, I think about the types of data that will be valuable to support businesses and organisations in our mobile, energy and water sectors. For example, we published information on the number of people covered by mobile networks without access to electricity and clean water who could hence benefit from this mobile ubiquity to improve access to these basic services (link here) or the impact of local energy access on mobile usage (increasing the monthly Average Revenue per User, i.e. the average revenue by mobile subscriber, by 10 to 15). We also work with partners who have local expertise to conduct research in emerging markets. In terms of communicating these pieces of evidence and fostering discussions, we regularly invite regional organisations to our working groups in Africa and Asia and participate to international conferences in the energy, water and development sectors. For example, we will co-organize a seminar with wash expert organisation IRC, Consultative Group to Assist the Poor (CGAP) and the World Bank Water &amp; Sanitation Programme at the next World Water Week in Stockholm in September and talk about the role of mobile in the energy and water sectors. Overall, since the start of our first Community Power from Mobile project in 2009 ,looking at how the presence of off grid telecom towers could improve rural electrification, we have built a strong network of partners in the mobile, finance, energy and water sectors. These contacts, who regularly participate in our events and relay the information we collect beyond our circle of influence, are keys to the success of our programme. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do &#8211; where do they start? MRN: I&#8217;m a technology person from university with a degree in microelectronics, then I spent time consulting for international organisations in the ICT sector for 5 years and volunteered with local NGOs especially working with homeless or low income people. I believe that there are three important elements for anyone who wants to get involved in such projects: Understand the technology &#8211; from hardware to software. ICT has a huge potential to solve some of the challenges faced by populations in emerging markets and one has to learn about these technological building blocks and how they can be applied to different products or services. Learn about how successful businesses are built &#8211; to help growing ideas, you need to be able to find out about the strengths and weaknesses of emerging business models and what type of support they need. Beyond the creation of a business, it&#8217;s also about understanding how building the ecosystem around a solution will be conducive to its growth. Then travel and meet people &#8211; I don&#8217;t think you can build or support the growth of a successful social enterprise if you don&#8217;t spend enough time with the people directly benefiting from a service or a product. But wherever is your home, you don&#8217;t need to travel far to meet people who need help, so find the place where you think you could have the most impact right now. I would also encourage anyone interested in working with the GSMA to visit our website as we have several job opportunities currently open. BFP: Finally, What do you hope to get out of being part of the BFP community? MRN: The Business Fight Poverty website and community is a great way to start discussions, create new contacts and learn about best practices in different sectors and regions. I welcome anyone to get in touch. Editor&#8217;s Note: Thank you to Michael Nique for taking the time to do this interview. We&#8217;re always looking out for members to feature.

22278,Yi Wei,https://businessfightspoverty.org/yi-wei,"BFP: What do you do? YW: I like to think that I help run the &#8220;R&amp;D&#8221; efforts of the Global WASH Initiative. I work on new initiatives like microfinance, new product development, new partnerships, and help new country programs replicate the success of our flagship program in Cambodia. BFP: What is the best part about your job/project? YW: I love working in such an open space that is the emerging markets . There is so much room for innovation and creativity, which translates into massive impact when executed well. I love going through the human-centered design process, moving from intimate one-on-one interviews with the users, to distilling our observations into insights, and then turning those insights into something that people would want to buy and that would improve their lives. Moreover, I work with an incredibly sharp and fun team of people who never fail to keep me on my toes and my stomach full of laughter. BFP: What has been your greatest challenge? YW: Working in the emerging markets/development space comes with its own set of unique challenges. Infrastructure is very poor. Going 5 kilometers can take up to an hour because of how poor the roads are. While the development sector is starting to embrace more market-based approaches, there still remain instances of contradictory efforts that inefficiently use resources due to lack of mutual understanding and coordination. The small businesses that we work with are often used to much different standards of business operations, and helping them improve their business practices can be a struggle in it of itself. However, it is in working through these challenges that make my job so interesting and fulfilling. I wouldn&#8217;t trade it for anything else at this point. BFP: How have you overcome these challenges? YW: Always maintain your sense of curiosity and remember to stay humble. Our efforts are just another piece of the puzzle in our efforts to make the world a better place. We are under no pretense that our work is the silver bullet for development&#8217;s issues. Rather, it is through constant iterations, intense listening, and the audacity to try and fail that we&#8217;re able to stumble upon brilliant solutions. If someone wants to do what you do – where do they start? Mine was a very serendipitous route. I actually ended up at iDE as a result of a fellowship after college. Prior to development, I was actually on track to pursue music professionally as an orchestral percussion. It turns out, it was actually my interests in music that got me the job. My boss Cordell Jacks said that I could come to Cambodia if I joined their band, and the rest is history! BFP: Finally, What do you hope to get out of being part of the BFP community? YW: I hope to find a community of support through members who inspire me with their tenacity and challenge me to always improve upon my work.

22469,Suvankar Mishra,https://businessfightspoverty.org/suvankar-mishra,"BFP: What do you do? SM: I engineer businesses for social impact, which works for eliminating poverty one farmer at a time. My prime focus is on designing and developing technology-driven solutions to access the rural market. The solutions are cross-sectoral and address a variety of economic and social needs viz. agriculture, food, nutrition, sanitation, market linkages, etc. through multiple technology modes like; software applications on smartphones/tablets, eCommerce platform linking farm-to-food, and peer-to-peer social investment platform eKutir is a social business based out of India that works with smallholder farmers using a distribution channel of locally trained entrepreneurs, technology, and data. We partner with civil society organizations, social enterprises, and public sector institutions to create the last-mile distribution channel for different products and services required by the farmers, using an entrepreneurship-tech approach. eKutir Social Business has multiple initiatives working in agriculture, sanitation, social finance, and farm-to-food channel. I primarily head the technology team, social finance team, fundraising, strategic partnerships, and manage large projects for eKutir. Since incubation, we have developed key partnerships with Grameen-Intel Social Business, World Toilet Organization, Unilever, Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, USAID, IFPRI and many more. BoP Connect is a start-up social venture, which creates a small scale farming model to feed the urban population with freshly sourced and naturally grown vegetables, fruits, and exotic vegetables. Based out of Delhi, India we are working on a demand driven food production system that will reduce wastage, mitigate the need for storage, and create a clean, lean supply chain to address the increasing demand for fresh fruits and vegetables. BFP: What is the best part about your job/project? SM: A sense of gratification on being able to see the impact of your work (small or large), an impact that changes lives of people in rural areas and gives them an opportunity to enhance their current state of livelihoods, is definitely the best part of my work. Through my work with eKutir and BoP Connect, I am primarily working with food, farmers, and technology. Today, we cannot survive without any one of these. We need food, we need farmers to produce food, and we are heavily reliant on cutting-edge technology. Instead of looking at them discreetly, I look at them in a connected manner. Farmers feed us, increased population demands more food, and cutting-edge technologies are making lives simpler and connected. Bringing these three elements together through different initiatives is a great boost to my work. BFP: What has been your greatest challenge? SM: At my work with eKutir, there were multiple challenges from distribution limitations to talent scarcity. But the key challenge I observed was the rapid diversification we were doing, from one thematic area to another. Within 5 years, eKutir set-up five different subsidiaries working on different products and services for the farming communities in India. It appeared to be a good move to mitigate risks and costs by creating a basket of different products and services, but it was important for us to start capitalizing on each one of them, efficiently. This required a lot of effort in team building, sourcing talent, building up business case, use case, and so on. The critical aspect was to balance innovation with execution, which would have significant impact on both the customers and business. BFP: How have you overcome these challenges? / What has been the secret of your success? / What advice can you give others? SM: I attribute this to a concerted effort between the founder of eKutir, its Directors, the team, and our key partners in creating a smooth transition of different subsidiaries of eKutir. Because of the good work eKutir has been doing with the farming communities, the use case of different products and services was experimented with them, giving us an opportunity to optimize our solution, measure its impact, and roll-out to the wider market by creating a separate subsidiary. The rationale behind all of our innovation was to create a holistic solution for addressing to the needs of the farming communities, as poverty is a complex issue and requires a complete solution that can sustain its impact in eliminating poverty. It is important to keep exploring within your enterprise, but it is equally pivotal to keep a check on the targets, sales, revenue, and impact created. The latter is the fuel for growth, while the former allows you to keep challenging the status quo. So, our customers and the strategic and gradual experimentation helped us to overcome the challenge associated with the diversification. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do – where do they start? SM: Today, I am looking at a lot of people, in the mid twenties to early thirties who are looking at earning while creating value. The future is in creating enterprises that work for the greater good of the community, nation, and the world. For me, social business was a leap of faith and during my journey I acquired these four critical learning’s; 1. Having a real-life mentor, whom you are able to work with, exchange knowledge, and take guidance on the basis of their experience. 2. Being open to criticism, developing patience, and having fun, as it is easy to be defensive and become impatient during your journey as a social entrepreneur. Taking constant advice from a mentor helps one to become flexible and not lose sight of the amount of hard work that needs to be put in to create impact. This flexibility helps to create a robust platform for yourself to keep doing what you are good at and acquire new skills too. 3. In social business or any traditional business, it is critical to work with the customers directly, tailoring products and services to best fit their need and address the problem at large. You must be willing to be on the move most of the time, if you want to make an impact and foster change. 4. Quick adaptation to change helps one to overcome unnecessary time and energy wasted on things that did not work. BFP: Finally, What do you hope to get out of being part of the BFP community? SM: Inspiration and Collaboration! The community brings together people from different parts of the world making a good mix of ideas, stories, and perspectives. This perception will help me get inspiration from the changemakers and stay enthusiastic on the fact that I am also a stakeholder among the rest of the BFP community, working to make the world a better place. The interaction, sharing, igniting new ideas, and having a multitudinal point of view through BFP will keep me enthused to take focused strides in my endeavor. I can and will be glad to contribute as much I can back to the BFP community. BFP: Finally, What do you hope to get out of being part of the BFP community? SM: Inspiration and Collaboration!

22661,Jack Castle,https://businessfightspoverty.org/jack-castle,"BFP: What do you do? JC: Living Goods operates networks of community health entrepreneurs in Uganda and Kenya. These are primarily women who earn income by selling low cost, high quality products to meet the needs of the household and improve the health of mothers and their children. Our model has proven to be a highly cost effective market based alternative to government and donor-run voluntary community health worker networks. These networks typically suffer from funding fluctuations, unreliable incomes and frequent product stock outs. In Uganda, our model has led to over a 20% reduction in under 5 mortality, and a 50% decrease in the prevalence of fake malaria drugs in the areas where our entrepreneurs work. Given this huge impact, we are looking to scale our model in Uganda, Kenya and other countries in Africa and Asia. However, we cannot do this alone. Our partnerships team is looking to scale the Living Goods model by providing advisory services to partners to develop replications of our last mile distribution platform. My role on the Strategic Partnerships Team is focused on identifying the best partners and managing some of our advisory projects, including one in Myanmar right now. BFP: What is the best part about your job/project? JC: Living Goods’ Strategic Partnerships team is a relatively new concept for our organization. It is really exciting to build this business channel with a brilliant and energetic team, where we continue to learn about the incredibly impactful work our partners are doing across the globe. We are fortunate to build our advisory services off of the strong foundation set by our founder, Chuck Slaughter, and our teams in Uganda and Kenya. BFP: What has been your greatest challenge? JC: One of the greatest challenges is also one of the most exciting bits of the role. We have to dig deep to understand our client’s current model and build an adaptation of the Living Goods model that can be poised for impact, scale and sustainability. Each client has a unique operating environment and their impact goals often vary from our core model. How have you overcome these challenges? / What has been the secret of your success? / What advice can you give others? JC: We aim to really understand the context and motivators for our clients. This starts with in depth country analysis to identify areas that are best suited for a replication of the Living Goods model, followed by detailed discussions with partners and funders. One of the most important elements for success of our projects comes down to finding the right team and leadership that is interested in failing fast to drive innovation of their models. I find that building these relationships and mutual understanding with clients is really imperative. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do – where do they start? JC: Since I started working in development, I have been motivated and challenged by colleagues, peers and mentors with a diverse array of experience. My degree in international development helped build my knowledge of the sector, while my private sector background in the finance industry helped build practical analytical skills and confidence to work with senior management of clients. From there I have been fortunate through luck and networking to find organisations that prioritize hiring young, talented people that are empowered to take initiative to drive change. BFP: Finally, What do you hope to get out of being part of the BFP community? JC: BFP provides a fantastic opportunity for mutual learning. I am impressed by the contributions of the community and the relevance of the content to my job. Through BFP, I hope to continue growing my knowledge on effective partnerships, new products for the BoP and unique last mile distribution strategies through active discussions and sharing of Living Goods’ innovations and experiences.

22787,Stephanie Hanson,https://businessfightspoverty.org/stephanie-hanson,"BFP: What do you do? SH: I am lucky to be part of the leadership team at One Acre Fund, where we all work in service of smallholder farmers—the 180,000 farmers in East Africa that we serve now, and the hundreds of thousands of farmers we hope to serve in the future. We provide farmers with a complete service bundle that includes the distribution of seed and fertilizer, financing, training, and market facilitation. This service bundle enables farmers to generate a permanent gain in farm income. BFP: What is the best part about your job/project? SH: No two days are the same! I love the diversity of my work. Some days I am in the field learning from our clients, and other days I am sharing what I’ve learned with influential individuals who can help create a more constructive policy environment for smallholder farmers. I manage our government relations and policy team, but I also help lead “frontier” areas at One Acre Fund—new, emerging areas of work that could completely alter our scale and impact trajectories. Our two current frontier areas are microfinance partnerships and government services (operational partnership with governments). Right now, I’m enjoying shaping the strategy and building the teams that will execute our microfinance partnerships and government services work. These teams are already working on formative partnerships in Rwanda and Ethiopia that could impact hundreds of thousands of smallholder farmers. BFP: What has been your greatest challenge? SH: Our biggest challenge is finding talented people to support our rapid organizational growth. I spend a lot of my time looking for the entrepreneurial, humble, results-oriented individuals who will help One Acre Fund reach one million farmers by 2020. Another ongoing challenge is how to remain nimble and continually urge ourselves to innovate. We are tackling a huge problem: There are hundreds of millions of smallholder farmers in the world. We’ve developed one operating model that has scaled to serve 180,000 farmers. But if you think about the total global demand, 180,000 is just a drop in the bucket. We need to keep innovating other tools, methods, or solutions that can reach millions of farmers. This will require us to partner with other organizations, like microfinance institutions and governments. BFP: How have you overcome these challenges? / What has been the secret of your success? / What advice can you give others ? SH: Finding talented people is an ongoing challenge, but we are getting better and better at it. We invest a lot of time in the candidate evaluation process, and we ask candidates to complete written exercises that address some of the major challenges or strategic questions they’ll need to tackle if they are hired. This allows candidates to evaluate fit and whether the role is right for them, and it allows us to evaluate a candidate’s style of working and approach to problem solving. Once we find great people, they tend to thrive in the One Acre Fund work environment. Our staff have lots of autonomy, interesting projects to work on, smart colleagues, and a passion for our “Farmers First” mission. It is not easy to remain nimble and to focus on innovation as you grow, but one of our core values is dreaming big, and it has really permeated our DNA as an organization. I have the opportunity to spend time at all of our country operations and I am continually impressed by the innovations that are being generated in all departments. We have a new department in Kenya called “scale innovations,” and it only works on figuring out ways to improve the execution and efficiency of our Kenya field operations. Our Rwanda operation has partnered with the Rwandan government to distribute fertilizer to 1/3 of Rwanda’s farmers. They pioneered a distribution system to reach farmers through agrodealers. Most of our innovations have emerged because individuals or teams have the ability to take a great idea, test it out, and scale it up if it works. Building this space for experimentation (and failure) has allowed us to continually innovate as we grow. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do – where do they start? SH: I worked in book publishing, and then I was a journalist at a foreign policy think tank, reporting on economic and political development in Africa. In the course of my reporting work, I discovered the importance of agriculture to overall poverty reduction, and I became interested in organizations that were using business tools to address agriculture development issues. It was a big risk for me to move to western Kenya and take a job at One Acre Fund. At the time, One Acre Fund was a small start-up, and the growth trajectory of the organization was uncertain. My path has been a non-linear one, so I am a firm believer that anyone who truly wants to serve others by using business approaches can make a career in this field. To do so, you probably need to have a few things: A tolerance for risk. Social enterprise is still a young field, so you need to be willing to work for organizations that are start-ups with uncertain futures. These opportunities are risky, but also present amazing opportunities for professional growth. Some kind of technical expertise. Social enterprises need some generalists who are smart and hard working, but they often need individuals with technical expertise, and those individuals are hard to find. If you have expertise in finance, IT, logistics, government relations, communications, or even construction, you will be a desirable candidate to many organizations. As One Acre Fund has matured as an organization, we need these experts more and more. The “hustler quotient.” Using business approaches to serve the poor is hard. You need to have what Elias Schulze, the Africa CEO of Kaymu, likes to call “the hustler quotient.” He defines this as an “epic disregard for constraints.” I would call it the ability to get things done in the face of continual, unexpected challenges. BFP: Finally, What do you hope to get out of being part of the BFP community? SH: I hope to learn from the practical experiences of other members of the BFP community. At One Acre Fund, we sometimes have our heads down, thinking about how to solve problems that are particular to our operating environment. However, it’s possible that other organizations in the energy or health sectors have tackled similar problems and developed scalable solutions. I think BFP is a great place to connect with practitioners who have innovated new ways to serve the bottom of the pyramid. And, of course, if any of those practitioners are interested in jobs at One Acre Fund, we have many open positions!

22853,Erica Frenkel,https://businessfightspoverty.org/erica-frenkel,"BFP: What do you do? EF: Gradian Health Systems is a social enterprise that works to improve access to safer surgery in low-income countries through improved anaesthesia technology. We sell and distribute the CE-marked Universal Anaesthesia Machine (UAM), a general anaesthesia machine designed to function with or without power and/or compressed oxygen, both of which are necessary to run conventional anaesthesia machines. As a social enterprise we are equally committed to providing the peripheral support needed to ensure the sustainability of improvements in surgical care: training of clinical and technical staff at installation, after-sales support &amp; maintenance and global advocacy to incorporate surgery and anaesthesia into the global health agenda. Within Gradian, I manage internal and external growth strategy. Internally, I try to figure out how to keep a lean US-based team that is effective and capable of growing our impact around the world. Externally, I work with my team to understand each of our markets individually and use that information to develop a sales strategy incorporating the right in-country people and processes. However, as a start-up with just 6 people we all end up working on all parts of the business to some extent – which is what makes it so much fun! BFP: What is the best part about your job/project? EF: The best part of my job is that it feels different every day. Just today I spent the morning reviewing our sales pipeline for our east African markets and then reviewed the footage for a documentary we are hoping to make to tell the story of anesthesia in the countries we work in. The afternoon was spent coordinating our in-country trainers and developing our written statement for the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal planning process. Really, the only constant is that each day I feel inspired and rewarded by the work I get to do with the others in my office and the many others in countries we work in around the world. BFP: What’s been your greatest challenge? EF: There are so many challenges within this work that it’s difficult to pull out just one. With respect to our product, we are trying to disrupt a system whereby machines are either sold or donated to hospitals that just simply don’t fit very well: the hospital experiences regular power shortages; compressed oxygen has been stocked out for the past 2 months; a small part on the machine broke but there is no service contract or engineer to fix it or the part is no longer manufactured; the list goes on… It’s not surprising, then, that there is often an instinct to assume that if something breaks or a part is needed, no one will respond. But our whole business is geared toward being available for just that call. So one of the challenges has been conveying that to our customers and ensuring we balance our follow up (“how are things going?”) with respect for their time. Distribution is also a tremendous challenge and often the greatest obstacle to scaling. This takes two forms. The first is quite literal: How do you get a piece of equipment from a factory in the UK (or anywhere) to an air- or seaport, through customs and to the hospital it’s bound for? How do you do that many times a week with out any hiccups? It’s incredibly important and incredibly challenging. My colleague who handles most of this wrote a blog piece on this. The second deals with distribution more broadly: Given considerable resource constraints, how do you create a sales pipeline when most customers have to fundraise and governmental processes are long and hard to anticipate? How do you build a service infrastructure to respond immediately to customers when a machine needs attention? How do you do that in a country where biomedical engineers are scarce? Finally, how do you do all this while maintaining a margin that keeps the price of the machine at a level that is affordable? BFP: How have you overcome these challenges?/What has been the secret of your success?/What advice can you give others? EF: We haven’t necessarily over come these challenges. They are the focus of much of our work every day. However, over time we realized that we were having the same conversation about these challenges with just about everyone else we knew working in our field or any other that involved moving and supporting a product in underserved markets. To try to tackle these issues we decided to get some of those folks together recently. We haven’t solved anything yet, but stay tuned… The only advice I can offer at this point is to focus almost maniacally on partnering with the best people possible in the markets to which you are distributing – and investing the time necessary to cultivating those relationships. This has to be seen as the crux of your business – you can have the best product on the market, but without a solid distribution plan, scaling will remain a challenge. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do, where do they start? EF: I think there are two forms of experience that are critical to get involved in market-based solutions for global health: living in a developing country and experience working at a start up. If you are based out of a high-income country, it is critical that you understand – really experience – what life is like in the markets you’re working in. There are of course many ways to pursue that. I call on my experiences as a Peace Corps Volunteer nearly every day. Over the course of 2.5 years in El Salvador, I learned not only how one lives in a setting so different from mine, but also how health is impacted by so many factors in one’s life (some controllable, some not). On top of that, I came to appreciate how business is conducted in a wholly different setting than any I’d ever known. Each country we work in is drastically different, but the experience of seeing another way of doing things has stuck with me and guided me through my subsequent work. Whether through Peace Corps or another route – get out there. Experience at a start-up is so incredibly valuable for just about any field for many reasons. At a small, growing company you learn, among many other things, how to be solutions-oriented and, at a company with a social mission, how to balance altruism with financial sustainability. In both of those pursuits, one is forced to constantly evaluate assumptions and ideas and redirect the course if a new/better approach presents itself. It forces both commitment and creative thinking that is an asset to any team in any setting. BFP: What do you hope to get out of being a part of the BfP community? EF: I’m always excited to learn about good work being done around the world and this seems to be a community full of many ways to define that. I’m also really looking forward to hearing how others have approached working at the confluence of business and development.

23154,Amanda Gardiner,https://businessfightspoverty.org/amanda-gardiner-2,"BFP: What do you do? AG: I’m the Director of Partnerships at Pearson, leading our engagement with organisations focused on addressing the world’s biggest global education challenges, particularly those affecting underserved and marginalized communities. These organisations tend to be UN and donor agencies, NGOs, and multi-stakeholder initiatives like the Global Business Coalition for Education, Global Partnership for Education, and World Economic Forum. In addition to managing relations with these stakeholders, I build strategic partnerships that leverage Pearson assets and competencies, in order to extend our social impact and create business value. Much of my job is externally-facing, but I also support Pearson’s leadership to develop frameworks for managing partnerships in the countries where we operate. For example, my team led a stakeholder mapping effort to identify the organisations and issues we should be prioritizing across key markets. And we recently concluded a social impact assessment in one of our key geographies, looking at how our operations have influenced the education system, supported job creation, and improved access to education for low-income communities. BFP: What is the best part about your job? AG: I love operating at the convergence of social impact and business strategy, making the case to leaders both inside and outside of Pearson that partnerships and ‘shared value’ models are the most sustainable way for us to make a contribution to improving global education for the most marginalized. That’s what motivates me and gets me out of bed in the morning. Delivering real social impact goes beyond donations, causes, and giving programs – though of course these are important – to understanding the needs of underserved communities where we operate, and adapting our business practices and processes to meet those needs effectively. It’s not easy, and partnerships are essential to make it work, but I believe this kind of social innovation will ultimately deliver more significant social and business returns. I’m also a people person, and one of the greatest perks of my job is the opportunity to work collaboratively with many different business units, as well as with a variety of external partners. When I think of ‘my team’, I imagine people from all over the world, both across the company and in NGOs, governments, and other organizations. I really value that diversity, the richness of being able to access different voices and perspectives. BFP: What has been your greatest challenge? AG: Ha! Explaining what I do is always a challenge! Many people (still) assume my work is about philanthropy, but a large part of my ‘every day’ is about changing mindsets, and challenging the way people think about the role a multinational company like Pearson can play in improving development and education outcomes around the world. Another challenge I have faced – in many jobs – is balancing the need to institutionalize partnerships inside an organization, with the need to sustain and nurture the personal relationships through which those partnerships form. Too often, the value of personal relationships is undersestimated in this field of work. I believe finding the right balance is crucial if partnerships are really to thrive and succeed. What makes this difficult is that the balance is different for different people, institutions, and relationships. But that’s also what makes it fun. BFP: What has been the secret of your success? / What advice can you give others? AG: While ‘shared value’ partnerships are becoming more mainstreamed, the reality is that this is still an emerging field of work. It is therefore important to find pockets of great people who understand its potential, and use them as advocates in advancing the agenda. Internal champions are particularly critical for success. In almost everything I do, whether it is developing a strategy, scoping a partner, or building a new project, I try to enlist support from a senior-level champion inside the company. This could be a global executive, a country president, or a business unit head. The important thing is to convince someone who makes – and influences – big decisions inside the company that a particular piece of ‘socially-focused’ work has the potential to add real business value. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do – where do they start? AG: There is no right path. After studying music in college and European affairs in graduate school, I essentially fell into business partnerships work during a brief stint at UNESCO early in my career. The experience made me realize there is huge, untapped potential for social impact in the corporate sector. I was hooked. My peers have come from business, academia, non-profits, and just about all over. Some have held roles in communications or project management, others in sales or product development. The skills I find critical to do my job include the ability to: empathise and communicate; interpret complex situations; project manage from end-to-end; and ultimately, create opportunities out of chaos. Diplomacy is important because of the need to negotiate different perspectives, motivations and intentions in order to arrive at a set of common goals among partners. Exposure to and understanding of both business and development issues are also incredibly helpful. BFP: Finally, What do you hope to get out of being part of the BFP community? AG: Business Fights Poverty is unique in that it brings together people committed to the role of business in development. The community of professionals is incredible – a core crowd of intelligent people who are truly passionate about this issue. What ties us all together is an aspiration to mainstream and evolve the notion of business for social good. And we’re all just a click away from each other. BFP is a go-to source of information for me &#8211; I follow BFP on Twitter, enjoy the weekly updates, and look forward to insights from business and other leaders via blogs, webinars and BFP-supported events. Because the BFP platform curates cutting-edge thinking on the issues most relevant to my work, it’s at the top of my list of great resources. And of course, Pearson is a proud supporter of the ‘Education Zone’. Editor&#8217;s Note: Thank you to Amanda Gardiner for taking the time to do this interview.

23236,Mike Quinn,https://businessfightspoverty.org/mike-quinn,"BFP: What do you do? MQ: In Africa, there is a tremendous pool of entrepreneurs, business owners, and young people who dream of making money and serving their communities but who lack the right opportunity, resources and support to reach their full potential. Zoona (which means &#8220;it&#8217;s real&#8221; in Zambia&#8217;s main local language) offers these Emerging Entrepreneurs an opportunity to provide money transfer and other payment services to low-income consumers while earning commissions, creating employment, and generating a recurring revenue stream. Our ambition is to build a billion dollar business that increases financial inclusion and helps businesses grow in Africa. BFP: What is the best part about your job/project? MQ: I love so many things about Zoona that it&#8217;s hard to pick one! If I had to, I would say the impact Zoona is having to enable emerging entrepreneurs in Africa to make money and serve their communities. We have built a network of over 500 entrepreneurs in Zambia who earn an average of $500 per month in commissions in a country where the GDP per capita is only $1,500 per year. These entrepreneurs provide a critical service to 700,000 consumers who use Zoona to move money among their friends, family, and businesses. Many of these consumers are financially excluded and don&#8217;t have many options to move money that is not in physical cash, so we are solving a major pain point for them. In addition, Zoona Entrepreneurs create jobs by hiring tellers and opening new outlets which in turn creates many positive knock-on effects. The majority of tellers are young women who don&#8217;t have many other opportunities, which is why Zoona was selected by the Nike Foundation and Unreasonable Institute for their Girl Effect Accelerator program. I am also inspired by the challenge of building a billion dollar business that started with very humble roots in Zambia. Zoona was literally conceptualized in a text message between the two founders back in 2008 who saw the opportunity to make money and make a difference at the same time. Since then, we have grown to process $30 million per month in transaction value and have nearly 100 employees. Despite these achievements, we still feel relatively insignificant with respect to the size of the problem and opportunity, which keeps us up at night and helps launch us out of bed in the morning. What has been your greatest challenge? MQ: Our greatest challenge has been learning how to scale. In the early days, this meant simply staying alive and generating enough cash flow to pay salaries at the end of the month. We then spent 18-months getting &#8220;investment ready&#8221; and fundraising to close what was the first ever international venture capital investment in Zambia from the Omidyar Network, Accion Frontier Investment Group, and Sarona Asset Management. What followed was two years of building a team, refining our core product offering, putting in places systems, processes and controls, building our culture, and really honing in on what our core customers wanted and were willing to pay for. We are now at the point where we believe we have done all of the hard work and are at the start of the next major challenge: scaling. We have just launched in Malawi and have plans to aggressively expand to as many markets as we can in the coming years. This is a new phase of our growth and one that will determine the size of our success over the coming years. BFP: How have you overcome these challenges? / What has been the secret of your success? / What advice can you give others ? MQ: Everything starts and ends with the management team. To be successful, it&#8217;s critical to have a cohesive team with clearly aligned incentives and well-defined roles and responsibilities. In a fast growth environment such as ours, these need to be constantly re-evaluated and redefined. If you have the right team in place, good things can and will happen. Secondly, define your core customer segment and focus relentlessly on meeting their needs through your products, processes, and people. This is much easier said than done, as the default option is usually to try to be all things to all people and finding excuses not to say &#8220;no.&#8221; The problem with not saying &#8220;no&#8221; is that it creates more work and adds complexity, which ultimately slows down growth. We have sometimes learned this the hard way but it&#8217;s a critically important lesson. Thirdly, build an awesome culture that A-players want to be a part of. Great people want to work with (and hire) other great people, so getting this right is crucial. At Zoona, we have been very purposeful crafting an employee experience that enables A-players to find their &#8220;flow&#8221; and want to give that extra effort to serve our customers. Our success in this area will perhaps be the biggest determinant of whether Zoona grows to become the awesome world-class business that we aspire to be. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do – where do they start? MQ: I don&#8217;t believe there is any one right route, but as a patriotic Canadian I will quote Wayne Gretzky to &#8220;skate to where the puck is going to be, not where it has been&#8221;. I started out as a Mechanical Engineering student in Vancouver and saw an opportunity to contribute to a new start-up organization called Engineers Without Borders. Upon graduating, I volunteered with EWB for 2.5 years in Ghana and Zambia without being able to pick out either country on a map before going there. I then went to do a Master&#8217;s in International Development Management at the London School of Economics before attending Oxford University&#8217;s Said Business School as a Skoll Scholar for Social Entrepreneurship. Upon completing my MBA, I went back to Zambia on a consulting contract from an investment fund in search of entrepreneurs to work with. I met the two founders of Zoona, helped facilitate a $200k early stage investment, and then jumped sides to work with them full time (which was made official when my parents mortgaged their house to lend me $100k to invest into what was a fledgling business). We had a great team dynamic from the beginning, and after a while they felt that I was best suited in the role of CEO while I felt it was my primary responsibility to unleash their full potential as entrepreneurs. This relationship and teamwork has only strengthened over the years. Entrepreneurship has always been in my veins and I love taking risks, but even if you are more risk averse than there are plenty of entrepreneurs out there who are battling to turn ideas into reality and need help and support. The best part about working with entrepreneurs is you get to contribute to creating the future. It&#8217;s sometimes a tumultuous journey but it&#8217;s always an incredible learning experience. BFP: Finally, What do you hope to get out of being part of the BFP community? MQ: It&#8217;s always great to be part of a community of like-minded individuals who are trying to make a difference in the world. That&#8217;s what impresses me with BFP &#8211; we all believe in the power of enterprise to drive growth and development. I look forward to building my BFP network and seeing what connections emerge! Editor&#8217;s Note: Thank you to Mike Quinn for taking the time to do this interview.

I help lead NEI, a social enterprise pioneering the sustainable production of natural flavours in Tanzania, starting with vanilla, cacao and orange. What is the best part about your job/project? In my role, I get to build an amazing team and directly impact the lives of over 1000 smallholder farmers. And the best part about our project is that it is making a real and tangible difference to these farmers, and to our team. NEI&#8217;s team is truly a mish mash of diamonds in the rough. I am very proud of them, and hope to continue coaching and mentoring each one in the years to come. What has been your greatest challenge? Facing a room of 50 disenchanted farmer champions, demanding why they should believe in NEI after they had been abandoned by vanilla buyers for nearly a decade before we arrived. Since then, we have injected tremendous energy and generated such momentum to completely turn around the vanilla cultivation industry here. How have you overcome these challenges? / What has been the secret of your success? Invest in people first and foremost, and conversely, remove poor team players as quickly as humanely possible. I cannot stress this enough. The rest will sound cliche: never give up, never surrender. Stay true and honest to your mission and the rest will follow. If someone wants to do what you do – where do they start? I have one of the most convoluted professional career paths that I know of. I started as a computer graphics R&amp;D engineer, followed by a management consulting career in health systems and health technology, then moving on to lease financing for micro and small enterprises, and now natural and sustainable food flavours. I set myself 3-5 year objectives that followed my passion and interests at the time. My life goal is to positively impact as many people as I can, with as best a team as I can muster. And NEI has a real chance at turning around the lives of thousands. Finally, What do you hope to get out of being part of the BFP community? Some people wish you luck, others talk about serendipity. I think of it as always taking the opportunity to network and to tell your own (or another&#8217;s) story. I hope the BFP community can join NEI on its mission, and in particular, to help get us sales leads so we can further increase the benefit to our farmers.

23622,Thea Anderson,https://businessfightspoverty.org/thea-anderson,"What do you do? I am the Senior Advisor at Mercy Corps focused on building and strengthening our inclusive finance portfolio. What that means is that I support our country teams to design and scale financial models and products that focus on those that are currently unbanked or underbanked. We focus on private-sector partnerships using innovative financial products and delivery platforms. What is the best part about your job? There are many exciting parts of my job but overall, the most rewarding is the opportunity to tackle barriers to finance in some of the most challenging places on earth. Mercy Corps works in 40 countries primarily in complex and fragile environments. What has been your greatest challenge? Countries with the highest poverty rates tend to have the weakest financial and mobile money infrastructure. It can be very challenging working in these contexts especially when there are weak or overly bureaucratic regulations around know your customer (KYC), ID requirements, and types of financial products or payment platforms. How have you overcome these challenges? While these are challenges, I find we can be successful when we take a systemic approach and engage with and understand the incentives of all the players including regulators, financial service providers, and most importantly the clients themselves. INGOs like Mercy Corps offer valuable insight about client populations to governments, multinational corporations and technology firms that don’t have first-hand knowledge of field realities and needs. In complex and fragile states, development actors like Mercy Corps can play a critical partnership role by mitigating risks for other actors. If someone wants to do what you do – where do they start? Get out there and actually work with and for financial institutions overseas or in your own country. When you really understand the incentives required by all parties you can be most effective. Finally, what do you hope to get out of being part of the BFP community? The BFP community provides a platform to engage with like-minded organisations and private sector actors that proactively want to decrease poverty around the world, especially in complex and conflict-impacted countries Editor&#8217;s Note: Thank you to Thea Anderson for taking the time to do this interview.

23701,Elizabeth Vazquez,https://businessfightspoverty.org/elizabeth-a-vazquez,"BFP: What do you do? EV: As the CEO of the global non-profit WEConnect International, I am responsible for mission delivery and impact. At WEConnect International, we help women-owned businesses succeed in global value chains, by identifying, educating, registering, and certifying women&#8217;s business enterprises based outside of the U.S. that are at least 51% owned, managed, and controlled by one or more women. We then connect them with multinational corporate buyers with over $700 billion in annual purchasing power. BFP: What is the best part about your job/project? EV: I firmly believe that you have to be passionate about what you do and remember how lucky you are to get to do the work. As CEO and Co-Founder of WEConnect International, I’ve met thousands of women business owners in every region of the world who care deeply about their companies and their communities. When they share their stories with me, I know that our work together to grow companies and create jobs is not easy, but important. BFP: What has been your greatest challenge? EV: With WEConnect International, there weren’t a lot of organizational models we could follow outside of the United States, so we had to take a lot of risks and try new things knowing that some of it would fail. There is a lot riding on how to build a sustainable not for profit model, and we want to make sure that the time and resources invested will lead to impact and success. One of the greatest challenges in our first five years has been building a team that can support a network of local representatives in several of the world’s most complex economies—Australia, Brazil, Chile, Canada, China, Colombia, Costa Rica, India, Indonesia, Israel, Jamaica, Mexico, Nigeria, Peru, South Africa, Turkey, the UK, etc. BFP: How have you overcome these challenges? / What has been the secret of your success? / What advice can you give others? EV: Collaboration is key. WEConnect International wouldn’t be as successful if it were not for some of the biggest corporations in the world coming together with the commitment to source more inclusively from women suppliers. My job was to build a global network capable of leveraging this amazing corporate commitment. We work with women business owners, senior policy officials, multilateral organizations, business associations, and other NGOs that help to make trade and economic development possible. It’s important to remember that you can’t fight poverty alone or from behind a desk. You have to be out there in the markets, listening, observing, changing. Knowing how and when to pivot when something can be improved is crucial. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do – where do they start? EV: If you’re willing to take risks and be creative, your potential in this field is limitless. Being curious and humble is very important because you need to always ask for the advice and guidance of those who came before you and of those you want to serve. You have to put yourself in very uncomfortable situations and spend time with people you do not yet know or understand. You have to be open to looking at the world from a range of lenses and be empathetic to why things are the way they are, while also channeling your frustration in a positive direction towards collective action. BFP: Finally, What do you hope to get out of being part of the BFP community? EV: I’m excited to be a part of a large global community dedicated to leveraging market based solutions in the fight against poverty. BFP heightens our awareness of the complexity of the issues, and by drawing from each other’s ideas, successes, and failures, we can all be more effective in our work to end poverty.

I focus on external stakeholder engagement, including managing the overall sustainability framework which includes a focus on women, water and wellbeing. BFP: What is the best part about your job/project? A: I love that Coca-Cola is committed to and invested in being part of the solution to South Africa’s socio-economic challenges – the fact that my job plays a role in making a positive impact in the communities where we operate is the best part of it! BFP: What has been your greatest challenge? A: Working with stakeholders across various sectors – we have common goals but very different points of view and approaches to addressing issues. BFP: How have you overcome these challenges? A: This challenge is actually what creates strength in partnering to address issues – although we have to work towards alignment, the process ensures that we reach a robust, multi-dimensional way of solving a problem. My advice: embrace conflict – it’s not necessarily a negative thing. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do – where do they start? A: You need to be someone who can engage and remain relevant – in a company boardroom all the way up to communities who are facing difficulties that cannot always be reduced to a PowerPoint presentation.

24214,Chad Jordan,https://businessfightspoverty.org/chad-jordan,"Business Fights Poverty member, Chad Jordan, reflects on his first year as CEO of Arrow Global Capital, which seeks to provide credit access to small business entrepreneurs in emerging markets in order to increase local capacity in a sustainable manner – employment creation, borrowing capacity, leadership growth, food/healthcare security, &amp; education access. It all started on a marker board. My small office was cluttered with the chaos of running a small international consulting firm. On one wall, though, I managed to find some empty white space to dream. Our team had started asking big questions a few months prior. We started thinking about, learning from, spending time around emerging entrepreneurs who found themselves in that so-called “missing middle” finance gap. We’d interacted with many men and women in this space before through our consulting work, but a more complete picture was coming into view. The conversations led to bigger questions, the questions led to sketches, and the sketches on that marker board led to a model that would – in theory – serve as a finance bridge for vetted entrepreneurs stuck in the missing middle. A university partnership that resulted in one massive research process pushed the new model forward. A few key partners and a naming brainstorm session later, Arrow Global Capital came into the world at the end of January 2014. The last year has been full of extremely high highs and some pretty tough lows. Our team has worked tirelessly, our attorneys have drafted and revised hundreds of documents, we’ve negotiated with vital stakeholders, we’ve convinced ourselves and our early champions that this will serve an unmet need. Our team is incredible, but I have a secret: I’m in above my head. I’ve found my uncomfort zone. When I started dreaming on my marker board all those months back, I didn’t plan on starting a new organization; in fact, that wasn’t even on my radar. I wanted to do a little research, to understand the proverbial “space” a little better. But the more I learned, the deeper I got. I realized we could unite many of the people already working in the missing middle gap under a single vision: to close the cycle and improve access to finance solutions for small- and medium-sized businesses in emerging markets. Our shared focus on local capacity would align us. A nonprofit structure would give us the best chance at success, given our unique capital mobilization process. I never expected to be the CEO of a nonprofit organization, especially because of my previous work with nonprofit organizations! But we’re working to become a self-sustaining nonprofit, one defined by low overhead and high ROI. My business conscience can sleep at night. Now back to that part about being in above my head. I’ve learned to embrace it. I’m comfortably uncomfortable. The days are long, the negotiations intense, the paperwork tedious. But then I get to visit one of the entrepreneurs we’re hoping to serve and the world seems right. The stress fades away, the tension in my neck and shoulders subsides. I make peace with the fact that some days just suck. I get to – if only fleetingly – remember why this matters. My energy is renewed. I don’t know what the future holds for Arrow, but I do know that I’m humbled to be part of an organization that is working to serve as a bridge for innovative, hard-working entrepreneurs around the globe, pushing them toward full commercial access in their local context. My first year as CEO of an emerging market finance platform has been nothing if not a twisting, turning, roller coaster of an adventure. And I wouldn’t trade it for anything. Bring it on, year two.",2015-04-08 00:00:51,Podcasts,Text,,✅,,,,,,,uploaded,,,,
24901,Marjolaine Chaintreau,https://businessfightspoverty.org/marjolaine-chaintreau,"BFP: What is your purpose? What drives you? I want to drive the economic empowerment of underserved communities by applying business solutions and resources, so these communities become the center of long-term sustainability. BFP: What do you do? I am currently Vice President for Citi Inclusive Finance providing financing opportunities, banking solutions and digital payment platforms for micro &amp; small businesses and underserved communities in Latin America and Africa. Citi Inclusive Finance is a specialist team that works across Citi businesses globally to develop solutions that enable the bank, its clients and partners to expand access to financial services and advance economic progress in underserved market segments. Citi’s work in this space is unique because our global footprint enables us to take on projects that require local currency, on-the-ground expertise and broad networks. We work with leading microfinance institutions, banks, corporations, governments, development agencies, non-profits, investors and service providers to develop and deliver diverse financing solutions; digital and mobile financial services; inclusive supply chain solutions; and payment technologies, among others. These activities are embedded into Citi’s core businesses and policies, rather than in a separate social responsibility unit. BFP: What is the best part about your job? The best part of my job is working with clients to expand access to financial services and contribute to the development of great social enterprises and scalable business platforms. As we see these market-based solutions scale up, we also see more sustainable impact in communities. For example, through Citi’s partnership with the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, more than one million female micro-business owners have benefitted from nearly $400 million in loans to grow their business in 24 different countries. BFP: What has been your greatest challenge? One of the greatest challenges is the scale and replication of successful models. There are still two billion people who are unbanked, according to The World Bank. That makes it harder for them to pay for what they need, safely save for the future or invest in their children’s education. That’s why our main focus is to build replicable programs, with strong partners from across sectors and integrating innovative and digital solutions. For example, in the Dominican Republic, Citi created Citi Mobile Collect. This makes it possible for small businesses and micro distributors to replace cash payments to their merchandise suppliers with mobile transactions, improving efficiency, security and reducing cost, whilst advancing financial inclusion. BFP: What has been the secret of your success? Energy, humility and persistence! Building scalable, sustainable models and commercial partnerships for change takes time and requires continued energy and humility to learn, test, improve processes and reiterate. One of the most important drivers of success is building the right team of complementary partners and to ensure all players have aligned interests and appropriate incentives for the model to succeed. BFP: If someone wants to do what you do – where do they start? In the field of business and social impact, I think it is important to build professional expertise in a technical area with deep understanding of development issues, as well as the flexibility to adapt and understand different environments. I started my career working for a microfinance institution in India, and then joined Citi in the corporate and investment banking division. These experiences were at two different ends of the financial system spectrum, but have helped me better approach the work I do today. BFP: What do you hope to get out of being part of the BFP community? The BFP community is very important to make sure we can learn from each other, meet the right partners and disseminate the most effective methodologies and business models. The community is so special because it goes across sectors and players: for-profit/non-profit institutions, impact/mainstream investors, public/private sector, as well as corporations/governments. No one organization can achieve its full impact in isolation. The key to business fighting poverty is cooperation between institutions.",2015-07-27 18:12:06,Podcasts,Text,,✅,,,,,,,uploaded,,,,
25423,Terri Bresenham,https://businessfightspoverty.org/terri-bresenham,"Yvette Torres-Rahman, Director of Partnerships at Business Fights Poverty interviews Terri Bresenham CEO, GE Sustainable Healthcare Solutions, a Business Call to Action member company. YTR: You recently announced a plan to reach more than two million healthcare professionals worldwide by 2020. In what way are you going to be supporting these healthcare professionals? TB: We are very committed to this idea of helping to provide more affordable and relevant healthcare systems for a large portion of the population who have little or no access to healthcare. We have a substantial focus on the skills that it takes to deliver quality healthcare; and so our investment in education of doctors, nurses and midwives in many ways remains modest when you look at the whole global expenditure on health care professional education. Africa for example, which is one of our primary markets, is one of the lowest in terms of the availability of trained healthcare professionals, so roughly 1.5 million additional educated healthcare professionals are needed if you look at Africa’s density and healthcare professionals needed per capita. As an organization we have been doing a lot across different markets in the space of education and skills development. In India, we are one of the key companies on the national skills development council for healthcare. It is a priority for the Indian government as well and we are looking at ways that we can create sustainable educational systems starting from high-school level through to the paraprofessionals and even the experts and the doctors. This means developing content, being able to have partners in the market which provide the training facilities or hands on experiences in healthcare systems, as well as look for ways to continue education &#8211; courses, certified or accredited graduation programmes. It helps to ensure that the quality of the delivery of the health care is done with the right skills. YTR: As part of developing those skills I understand that you are also looking to capture these growing emerging healthcare markets through the development of low-cost technologies. TB: We are not necessarily trying to replicate the western model of healthcare delivery because we know in many ways it’s too expensive and it doesn’t necessarily lead to better outcomes. What we are looking at is an opportunity to be really disruptively innovative in using technology to do things that haven&#8217;t been invented before for these emerging economies &#8211;different kinds of access points, different levels of skills and being able to extend the ability of the expertise that might be there through channels like telecommunications. But we are not only doing things that we already know how to do, we are taking a clean sheet of paper and really co-creating with the providers in these markets relevant solutions that can operate in these environments, which are low cost but also have a way to improve the outcomes from the patient’s standpoint. YTR: Have you brought any of these low-cost technologies to market yet? TB: Yes, we have had a number of recent examples that have exceeded our expectations from a business case. One of the top reasons people suffer mortality in the world is from trauma, like auto or motorcycle accidents or farming incidences. If you have to travel very far to be seen you are unlikely to make it. We know that computer tomography or CT is one of the most valuable and innovative diagnostic tools for trauma, for heart disease, for many of the cancer detections and yet it is something that still is too expensive for large portions of the population and so we took another look at CT and we came up with a whole new design. We developed this design with technicians who would be new users of CT to make sure there wouldn’t be any adoption barriers, and ensure they could operate the system with the right quality of information. Starting with the heart of the system, which is the detector itself, we made it far smaller and less expensive, it runs on about half the power so the total cost of ownership and operational cost is about 40% less expensive. The interface is very graphical so someone who doesn’t have the same level of experience can use it. This CT system which can now be put in place in a smaller village can provide quick insight into what&#8217;s going on in the internal organs and be life saving. YTR: And looking at the big picture now: what is the business case for say medical practitioners, governments, private operators and investors to deliver affordable care in these emerging economies? TB: I think it’s the most important question and when it comes to expanding access across the world, it’s inextricably linked to affordability and the skill set that is required to ensure that the quality is there. We also have to provide the care pathways and understanding on how to treat a patient in different areas whether that’s a cardiovascular disease or diabetes or oncology, maternal and infant care for example and also the operational skill and capital structures that it takes to set up a sustainable healthcare model. One thing that is really important when we look at bringing solutions to developing countries is for there to be multiple sets of partners that want to work together. Now NGO communities and companies like ours are very comfortable to come together to ensure that the healthcare network covers the village with basic care needs all the way up to surgery or urgent or even acute care needs where that’s necessary. When you do that you can build a system that also has what I call microeconomic return because it keeps the incentive across the network at the right level. It’s really what ensures sustainability because it continues to be self-funding along the way and if at any point of the juncture, there&#8217;s a breakdown in the microeconomics, it will limit or put at risk the system’s ability to sustain itself. That is why we work to make sure that throughout the value chain there’s microeconomics linked to it, ensuring it is much more sustainable. YTR: Thank you very much, Terri, for joining us today and we would love to hear more when you next bring a new low cost technology to market. TB: Thank you for covering this topic, Yvette &#8211; we feel it’s very important for changing outcomes for people around the world.",2016-01-25 15:02:35,Podcasts,Text,,✅,,,,,,,uploaded,,,,
25474,Liisa Petrykowska,https://businessfightspoverty.org/liisa-petrykowska,"Yvette Torres-Rahman, Partnerships Director at Business Fights Poverty, interviews Liisa Petrykowska, Managing Director of Ignitia, a member of Business Call to Action. YTR: Ignitia helps small-scale farmers in West Africa to increase their yields by providing them with highly accurate weather forecasts straight to their mobile phones. Please tell us more about how Ignitia first came about. LP: It actually came out of a moment of frustration. At this time I was doing research on the cooler parts in the Arctic but every time I spotted one of these rare clouds there wouldn’t be any suitable satellite around to monitor it and I was asking myself &#8211; “why is it that there are so many weather satellites around the equator and none at the moment in the Arctic where I need coverage?”. Among atmospheric scientists it is well known that near the equator area where the tropics are there isn’t even a reliable weather forecast, so looking back this was probably my eureka moment &#8211; “great satellite coverage in countries around equator but still no reliable weather forecasts in the 21st century!” &#8211; and it is such a basic service that we take for granted in Europe. So this sparked me to look further and tackle the challenge of weather forecasting for the tropics. The weather conditions are significantly different to what we are used to and where traditional models for weather prediction fail to provide reliable forecasts; so a couple of months in I got a few research colleagues together and then we started Ignitia. It took us about three years of research before we had a product to offer, but now we are in the market with a product called iska, and we provide farmers with weather forecasts that increase their yields. It’s as easy as dialling *455# to start in Ghana. YTR: To what extent does weather impact farmers’ yields? LP: The interesting thing with farming and weather is that it is very reliant on accurately predicting rainfall, so choosing the wrong date for an action such as planting can make a real difference between great yields and crop failure. Many small-scale farmers in Africa rely on traditional farming methods, which means that plants only get watered by rain. So they only have one chance to make the right decision. If they get the timing of the rain wrong, they can’t afford to buy new seeds. So what a reliable weather forecast can do is help farmers to time their actions wisely. Since the day we started producing forecasts for West Africa I have met many rural farmers that have doubled their yields, this translates into about 80% increase in income which is a huge difference for small scale farmers. YTR: In the last rainy season, I hear you are achieving a weather prediction accuracy of 84% in Ghana &#8211; do other services offer similar accuracy to you? LP: Not that I am aware of. We have now been active and producing weather forecasts for three rainy seasons in West Africa and it’s a bit early to come to a conclusion but what we’ve seen so far is that we have managed to produce forecasts within average accuracy of 82% in Ghana and this season the number bumped up to 84% accuracy. Compared to forecasts made in West Africa on the major TV channels around the world this is outstanding. An average global weather forecast has an accuracy rate of 40% for West Africa, which then would translate into more wrong forecasts than right forecasts. I think our high accuracy is the main reason farmers are happy to pay for such a service. YTR: How does the cost of subscribing to a season of weather forecasting compare to a farmer’s overall cost of input? LP: When we set the price for the forecast we intended to have the cost so low that any African farmer would be able to afford it. It works out at about 4 cents [0.04 USD] per forecast message, so it’s like they are paying in micro instalments over the season. The total cost of forecasts for one farming season is less than 2% of their overall investment in such things as fertilizers, seeds and other inputs. YTR: Because your revenue is based on micro charges of a few cents per transaction, building scale is going to be quite crucial to your business. What challenges are you facing to scaling up your reach? LP: Well firstly, I think that just creating the awareness for our forecasting to our core customers, which are rural farmers in Africa, is a huge challenge. We need to find some kind of low cost solution for marketing that reaches all the way to the steep lands of Savannah and this is easier said than done. The second major challenge we have is recruiting market scale business developers who are willing to both live and work in West Africa. We get a lot of applications from young volunteers but finding the talent with good experience and skills in business development is still quite a bottleneck to growth for us. YTR: Which marketing strategy is working best for you? LP: We have been doing a lot of text message advertisement &#8211; it is very cheap to do and you can reach scale pretty fast but it’s limited to users who understand English. Especially in Ghana, where there are about 52 different local languages, it is very hard to know what language to use. We have tried sending messages in English and local languages. English has a clear advantage because even illiterate farmers who speak a little English can recognize words. And because the text messages are structured very simply using similar language each time they can learn to recognise the pattern and what that means e.g. rain or no rain. But our challenge is to find an even more effective way to scale up our awareness amongst farmers! YTR: Thank you for your time Liisa. I would like to invite members who are tackling a similar challenge to share their learnings. LP: Thank you very much!",2016-02-09 21:25:46,Podcasts,Text,,✅,,,,,,,uploaded,,,,
25876,Brian Sullivan,https://businessfightspoverty.org/brian-sullivan,"As part of our focus on Business and the Sustainable Development Goals, we interviewed Brian Sullivan about the work he is doing at Google to tackle deforestation and overfishing. BFP: Tell us about your role at Google Brian: I am a Program Manager for Google Ocean &amp; Earth Outreach, a team dedicated to leveraging and developing Google’s infrastructure to address global environmental, health &amp; humanitarian issues through partnerships with nonprofits, educational institutions and research groups. We are looking at how our experience in data and visualisation can help scale up programmes that are tackling some of the biggest challenges facing our planet. Two of our larger projects underway are focused on understanding deforestation and large scale commercial fishing at global scales. In both cases we believe that technology can be transformative by making data more transparent. We identify initiatives that are already underway and see how we can help them achieve greater impact. On the forestry project, Global Forest Watch, we partnered with an existing initiative run by Imazon, an environmental group in Brazil, the University of Maryland and World Resources Institute (WRI). Using Google’s Earth Engine and cloud computing capacity, we have been able to process vast amounts of satellite imagery to visualise what is happening to our forests, and update this in near real-time; global analysis that would take hundreds of years to run on a high end workstation can be done in a matter of a day or so on Google’s infrastructure. We have also been able to expand the scope from an initial small project area in the Amazon, to the entire Amazon Basin and now to the whole world. Android phones loaded with ODK, an open source application, enables individuals and indigenous groups to share geo-tagged photographs of what is happening on the ground, allowing consistent measurement. Ultimately, our aim is not to punish bad behaviour, but to drive change by creating transparency around who is doing well, and enabling people to learn from their experience. Just over a year ago, we launched another initiative, Global Fishing Watch, in partnership with two environmental NGOs, SkyTruth and Oceana. Our algorithms translate near real-time data on large-scale commercial fishing vessel movements to map where and when boats are fishing over time creating a view that was never possible before. Global Fishing Watch will ultimately give anyone with an internet connection a simple, online platform to visualize, track and share information about fishing activity worldwide to further the challenge of global sustainable fisheries. BFP: Have you looked at applying these approaches to other issues? Brian: We have been exploring how we can help eliminate malaria, in partnership with the School of Medicine at the University of California, San Francisco. Using historic and new satellite data, we can map where outbreaks have occurred, and more importantly predict from the correlation with environmental factors (like proximity to water, temperature and vegetation) where malaria is likely to be transmitted in the future. That can be a powerful tool for governments needing to target their scarce health resources, as well as for NGOs and businesses committed to partnering in the fight against malaria. Another area we have been looking at is air quality. In partnering with EDF and equipping our street view cars with methane sensors, we are building up a picture in the US of air quality, and creating the opportunity for officials and the public to correlate this with policy and other environmental factors. BFP: What have you learnt from getting these initiatives off the ground, and what advice would you have for others? Brian: Finding the right partners is absolutely key. They need to fit culturally and have a similar vision. We look for organisations that are hungry about what they are trying to achieve, have a good understanding of technology, and have the capacity to drive the programme. Effectively reaching out to talent within Google has also been critical. Employees are allowed to volunteer 20% of their time, and we draw on this to help staff some initiatives. One thing I have found is that speaking the right language is crucial to getting people on board. Within Google, some colleagues are excited by the technical challenge, so when I approach them, that’s how the opportunity needs to be framed. For others, they are primarily driven by a passion for the issue we focusing on. The excitement is contagious – once I get 2 or 3 people in, others hear about what we are doing and want to be involved. Rewarding people is also important; I make a point of telling their managers how they are contributing to these high-impact projects and ensure they are getting what they need out of the project. BFP: How can organisations partner with you? Brian: Each year we invite 100 people from the non-profit sector to attend a one-week workshop at our headquarters in Mountain View, California. Participants receive hands on training of Google tools and opportunities to hear how other non-profits are using them to further their missions. Our strategy is to identify and focus on a small number of large initiatives, while enabling other nonprofits to be self-sufficient. In addition, any non-profits can access free tools via the Google Earth Outreach website. BFP: How did you get involved in this, and what do you enjoy most about your work? Brian: I joined Google about 9 years ago, after working in West Africa on digital divide issues as well as a few years as a strategy consultant in the financial services. From the very beginning of my time at Google, I was keen to join the Earth Outreach team and found a way to make the move after a few years. I am passionate about the idea that data transparency can drive transformative change, and I enjoy working with external partners and internal colleagues from across the business to deliver impact.",2016-04-21 12:02:27,Podcasts,Text,,✅,,,,,,,uploaded,,,,
26278,"Jeric Sevilla, Manilla Water",https://businessfightspoverty.org/jeric-sevilla,"Manila Water in the Philippines recently won The Unilever Global Development Award, supported by Business Fights Poverty. What do you think impressed the judges the most? The Company’s social focus on giving greater access to the low-income communities is a major motivation given the large percentage of urban poor communities in eastern Metro Manila. Technically, we also found out that at the start of the concession that 50% of our water losses come from illegal connections very dominant in depressed and blighted communities so our thrust was reduce our losses so that water recovered could be re-distributed and re-channelled to underserved and areas without water. Manila Water employed a combination of social, stakeholder engagement, engineering and technical interventions to make this happen. Manila Water also restructured its organization by way of the Territory Management approach in order that focus will be centered on our customers, particularly those who have less or no access to water, and determine their needs and wants. This allows for more personal interaction with our customers which brings our services closer to the people. Poor access to water leads to major health risks, how has your Water for the Poor Programme managed to address these challenges whilst reducing the cost of water at the same time? People living in urban poor communities were used to getting free water through illegal connections and it was doubly difficult to convince them to ‘legalize’ and ‘regularize’ their connections. A key approach is to strengthen our engagement with different stakeholder groups by showing them the features, advantages and benefits of having legal water service connections both from the social, health, financial and environment perspectives. We had to secure the help of town councils and organize the communities while offering reasonable payment terms for the people while keeping the cost of water affordable for them. Manila Water inherited a very old water system that needed replacement and rehabilitation. Financing our capital investment program in terms of replacing the water lines was a challenge when we started in 1997 because of the Asian financial crisis. We had to secure loans from local banks as well as get the approval of international financing institutions regarding the viability of our programs. Over half of the customers you have added to your base since 1997 have been from the lower income group. How important has this growth been to the company? The programme has been beneficial to both the business and the community. Among the realized business benefits are as follows: Reduction in non-revenue water. From a high system loss of 63%, it is now down to 11%. This is equivalent to a medium-sized dam where the government and Manila Water could have spent a sizeable amount. Increased water supply distributed to unserved and underserved areas despite no water sources developed. Without additional water sources, water recovered from the system loss reduction programs was able to supply the needs of areas without water and those who are underserved. Increased billed volume resulting to increased revenues. From 440 million liters per day of potable water, Manila Water now provides more than 1.3 billion liters of water to more than 6.3 residents of eastern Metro Manila and adjacent Rizal Province. Increased number of service connections resulting to regulatory compliance. As Manila Water is a regulated by the State’s Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System through a concession agreement, we are able to comply with the regulatory requirements in so far as provider access to water is concerned. Higher collection efficiency. Manila Water averages 99 to 100% collection efficiency due to strong collection from urban poor communities. Strengthened engagement with customers as supporters and advocates. Key to the success of the Water for the Community Programme is strong engagement with various stakeholders from the regulators to the communities to the individuals including employees and service providers. In doing this program, it has also improved the social and environmental profile of Manila Water both locally and internationally. World Water Week focused this year on the link between water and development. In what ways has Manila Water been able to contribute to the development of local communities? Manila Water looks at community development holistically. It is a triumvirate of water provision, provision for sanitation and sewerage and provision for livelihood to sustain the first two services. We had to make connection charges affordable to customers. Savings of families from the provision of water have redounded to increased productivity and additional budget for other family needs such as food and education. The livelihood program, in coordination with the Manila Water Foundation, has allowed community cooperatives to have participation in the Manila Water supply chain. What challenges lie ahead for Manila Water? Rising customer expectations provide the biggest challenge for Manila Water as we had to anchor our operations in the way that would meet the customer expectations. The company has started the use of the Geographic Information System as well as the Enterprise Asset Management Information System to enable faster resolution to customer concerns. We need to be able to address water security for Metro Manila, make our facilities disaster-resilient against the continuing threats of climate change, inculcating the need for used water management as well as environmental sustainability. In the future, Manila Water looks into various programs and innovations that will facilitate water provision including the following: Cheaper technologies on desalination and less reliance on the construction of dams tapping freshwater reserves Extensive microtunnelling to lessen public inconvenience of excavating roads causing traffic More and cheaper water-saving devices that can be used within the homes and not only in commercial or industrial establishments A dual-piping system for clean drinking water and grey or re-used water More extensive programs on water re-use and water recycling",2016-09-07 16:21:03,Podcasts,Text,,✅,,,,,,,uploaded,,,,
401422,Gib Bulloch,https://businessfightspoverty.org/gib-bulloch,"Through the Business Fights Poverty Challenge on Corporate Social Innovation we are focusing on how companies can develop systems that drive commercial innovation with social impact. That is, how they can help &#8220;intrapreneurs&#8221; &#8211; those pioneering people within companies &#8211; survive and thrive, and more broadly how they can embed an intrapreneurial culture. As part of this, Katie Hyson, Director of Thought Leadership at Business Fights Poverty, recently caught up with Gib Bulloch to talk to him about his new book &#8220;The Intrapreneur&#8221; and his move from Accenture Development Partners founder to intrapreneur at large. BFP: Why did you choose to write this book? Gib: Three years ago I had a significant wake up call, health wise. I am a strong believer that you can’t always chose what happens to you, but you can chose how to respond. I’ve never been one to let a good crisis go to waste – this book is part of the outcome of this experience. I want to stand up and be counted around the taboo subject of mental health in the workplace. Particularly, as leading up to my personal bump I would have always considered myself happy, so it came as a bit of a surprise. Having been through this experience I realise that mental health is where LGBT was 10 years ago: hidden, unspoken and holding people and business back. But this book is 20% about my personal mental health experience and 80% focused on the mental health of the corporate system. I want this book to open the conversation around the craziness of today’s de- facto short termism ‘at the expense of everything else’ within business &#8211; shareholder demands, quarterly reporting, revenue based performance. However, I’m an optimist, I believe strongly that there is a real opportunity to re-imagine business. What if business were to focus on creating innovative solutions to social and environmental challenges and became truly purpose and values led? BFP: Why can intrapreneurism help business? Gib: Firstly, I think there are three key drivers, which are demanding the shift in today’s business operating models: Society’s perception of why business exists and an increasing scepticism as to whether organisations have permission to do business if their sole function is to profit shareholders; The huge business opportunities and untapped markets available if businesses refocus their efforts on trying to solve big societal problems; The war on talent: no self-respecting business will be able to attract and retain top talent unless it can tell an authentic and integrated story on ‘purpose’. A solution: unleashing the power of values based people within business. Intrapreneurs. A term coined in 1970s by Gifford Pinchot III, which has evolved into describing someone who works inside business innovating practical solutions to social or environmental challenges whilst simultaneously delivering value to the business – I am a believer that intrapreneurs can not only be part of the solution to addressing society’s big challenges; they can also help business fully engage with their purpose, their people and consumers. BFP: Is intrapreneurship at scale yet? Gib: No, if you asked the average CEO what an intrapreneur was – they wouldn’t be able to give you an answer. At the moment, this is a movement-growing bottom up, which is building momentum, with a growing awareness and excitement around the topic. BFP: What is holding intrapreneurism back? Gib: What concerns me is the evidence, and my personal experience of driven, innovative and talented people with intrapreneurial spirit lining up to leave business. Businesses are haemorrhaging their intrapreneurs because they don’t necessarily know how to spot them and how to then nurture them. It’s the businesses that are missing out, they are loosing not just great talent, but real business opportunities and the diversity in thought needed to stay agile. Worse, the intrinsic ‘corporate immune systems’: short-term reward systems, annual appraisals, corporate policy implemented by well meaning mid-management following the rules are all perpetuating the norm and group thinking. If an intrapreneur attempts to change the system, a set of anti-bodies are typically unleashed by the parent organisation to try to attack anything that doesn’t look like it’s maximising short term profit in the next quarter. BFP: How can we encourage business to understand the benefits of their intrapreneurs? Gib: It’s one of the reasons for writing this book. This book isn’t a business book, with takeaways, pretty charts and graphs; instead it tells a story about opportunities, to inspire action of what could be and the power of purposeful people within business. And its also the reason why I am supporting the League of Intrapreneurs, DFID and Business Fights Poverty collaborative research: The Intrapreneur Systems Challenge, to help create strong stable systems within business which understand and better support their intrapreneurs. Not everyone needs to be an intrapreneur – with an idea, but we can all work together, collaborate, to bring our strengths to help make this systemic shift. BFP: What next for you Gib? Gib: I know that the rest of my career will be spent challenging the role of business in society. My next big project involves redeveloping a derelict farm on the Isle of Bute in Scotland where I grew up. I’m trying to create a space for entrepreneurs and intrapreneurs to really connect with social impact and business purpose, in a peaceful and beautiful rural setting. Watch this space to find out more! If purpose was a drug, then I am an addict-turned-drug-dealer. Yep, I am on a mission to get others hooked too. &nbsp; About Gib Having spent 25 years in the business world at three of the world’s largest companies – BP, Mars and most recently, Accenture – Gib has a unique perspective on the role of business in society. During his time at Accenture, he set up the award-winning Accenture Development Partnerships, a corporate social enterprise that provided development sector organisations access to Accenture’s top people, knowledge and assets on a not-for-profit basis, and which delivered quarter of a billion dollars worth of services across 70 countries in its first decade.

401712,Lord Mark Price,https://businessfightspoverty.org/interview-with-the-lord-price-cvo,"Life peer, The Lord Price CVO, Baron Price of Sturminster Newton – also known as Mark began his career at The John Lewis Partnership. Working his way up from graduate trainee for 33 years to Waitrose’ Managing Director and then Deputy Chairman of The John Lewis Partnership. During this time Mark was also founding Chairman of The Prince&#8217;s Countryside Fund for HRH The Prince of Wales, Chairman of Business in the Community and Deputy Chairman of Channel 4 TV. Mark’s non-executive roles were replaced in 2016 when he joined the UK Government as Minister of State for Trade and Investment. Stepping down a year later Mark is now dedicating his life, as he says: ‘to making people and business happier!’ Mark’s latest research; ‘Apostles and Anarchists. An assessment of job satisfaction and engagement’ reveals the correlation between happiness of people at work and engagement in the workplace. Business Fights Poverty’s Katie Hyson was fortunate to catch up with Mark and talk more about his passion for happy employees and the vital role business plays in society. BFP: What does purposeful business mean to you? Mark: After 30 plus years in John Lewis Partnership I have come to learn one key thing, happiness in the workplace is the key to better business. Happy employees give more, which means customers get more. Suppliers and communities all benefit as a result and so do shareholders. I think there are six key factors, which drive employee happiness: Reward and recognition Information sharing Empowerment Well-being Instilling pride Job satisfaction Number five; instilling pride is all about purposeful business. In my experience, people are more inclined to go over and above discretionary effort when they have pride in their workplace and also in its status in society. Further, in my view, damaging the environment and acting irresponsibly for the short-term benefit of those looking for a quick return on capital is morally bankrupt. Short termism has arguably driven down the trust in business and the growing discontent with capitalism. In my book: ‘Fairness For All’ I go into this in some detail as to why employee happiness and spend a whole section exploring how different organisations have instilled pride through small local community actions right up to embedded and integrated corporate social products and services. BFP: What is the role for civil society, including NGOs, to play in helping business be responsible, purposeful and a happy place? Mark: In my experience, the deepest positive societal impact comes when NGOs and businesses collaborate and work together for common goals. Although I know that NGOs play a vital role in lobbying and campaigning, I am also indebted to organisations such as Fairtrade for working closely with us in order to gain better understanding of and to build proactive support for farmers and small businesses within our supply chains when I was at Waitrose. BFP: What is the role of policy makers in creating better business? Mark: I am not an advocate for unconstrained capitalism; companies, more than ever need to be actively involved in supporting their supply chains, communities and consumers. Policy makers can help by creating the environment for businesses to do this – whether it’s increasing the conversation about employees on boards, ensuring taxes are paid and then invested into health, schools etc. BFP: What trends do you see in progress towards better business? Mark: I am not convinced, at the moment, that business is going in the right direction. I see management teams struggling to adapt to the digital revolution, workforces who feel the world is changing but who don&#8217;t see this in their day to day. I think there is a ground up feeling of lack of empowerment and lack of informed understanding. Workforces need to be engaged and empowered for this new digital era. Whether through workplace training or re-training; we need to help build understanding in new skills and new roles. I know that happier workforces result in increased production, better service delivery and ultimately increased profitability. But uncertainty brings with it a drop in happiness. Businesses need to address this at the workforce level now. BFP: What would you recommend to businesses, in order to stay relevant and to create a happier workforce? Mark: To get measuring. Businesses need to measure their workplace happiness and workforce engagement. It will give them real insight into their corporate performance, their service levels and how resilient their businesses are. I firm believer this is as important, if not more important, than the profit and loss sheets executive committees currently pore over each week and it is certainly not hippy, fluffy, self-indulgence stuff. Measuring workplace happiness can be as simple as sickness days and staff turnover. My Engaging Works online diagnostic tool takes it to another level. The tool enables whole businesses to understand better their workforce’s happiness, and also empowers individuals. Everyone can take the short questionnaire and the output of the diagnostics tool provides recommendations into how to make your own workplace experience happier. My next ambition is to develop a job-matching capability, so that people can, not only find what roles would make them happiest, but then go on to be matched to just such jobs.",2018-06-25 10:32:35,Podcasts,Text,,✅,,,,,,,uploaded,,,,
401725,Dominic White,https://businessfightspoverty.org/interview-with-dominic-white-co-founder-uk-ssd-and-head-of-international-development-policy-wwf-uk,"Today marks the launch of Measuring Up, the UK Stakeholders for Sustainable Development’s (UKSSD) first stock take of progress across the UK against all the 169 targets identified in the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Business Fights Poverty’s Katie Hyson caught up with Dominic White, co-founder and co-chair of UK-SSD, as well as Head of International Development Policy at WWF-UK and former Chair of Bond, a network for International Development organisations in UK. BFP: Dominic, what is your experience at the interface between tackling poverty and managing the environment? Dominic: We all depend on the natural environment for the basics in life that we take for granted – the food we eat, the air we breathe and the water we drink. But when these assets are degraded or destroyed it is often the poorest people who feel it most as they depend most directly on these resources locally. Sadly there are so many examples of where our demand for natural resources has outstripped supply – we see it often with freshwater rivers or lakes such as the Aral Sea – dried up and with toxic residues from agriculture. I’ve seen communities in Tanzania where poorly planned industrial agriculture, has led to rivers running dry downstream leaving local villagers little choice but to send their daughters to collect water missing their schooling as result. Where common resources are shared – for example, un-gazetted forests, I’ve seen that the “tragedy of the commons” where it’s a free for all and unregulated or illegal demand outstrips supply of forest food, fibres and timber. This leaves forests degraded and means local communities have to go further afield to fulfil their needs. But this is not a feature of poverty: Closer to home, stocks of North Sea cod were once one of the world’s great fisheries that came perilously close to collapse in the 2000’s due to overfishing, only now after careful management are these stocks starting to recover. People living in poverty are most directly dependent on natural resources, for example harvesting wild foods and using locally collected building materials. But greed and the environment are linked too! All of us are connected to the natural environment – the environment is the source of raw materials for the food we eat, clothes we wear and things we buy, its just we in richer countries don’t always make the connection between our consumption and the natural world. Often those of us in developed countries have outsourced our pollution and the negative impacts of over-consumption to other countries. We often justify this as trade or development but the reality is 20% of the richest people in the world consume 80% of the world’s resources – if everyone lived like we do we’d need 3 planets to support us all. BFP: In your opinion, what is the role of business in tackling poverty and protecting the environment? Dominic: A thriving company that wants to stay in business is one where there is a full understanding of the positive and negative impacts of the business on people and planet. There is a growing awareness amongst leading businesses that there are limits to their supply chains. Supply chains need to be managed sustainably if they want to see a steady supply of goods in the long term. My personal experience lies in the renewables space, which is why so many of my examples are around natural resources, but this issue is as applicable to finite resources such as minerals and metals. Managing natural resources sustainably is better for people as well as the environment, it means that those people working in supply chains; from cotton ginners to garment workers, fishermen to canning factories will also have job security. Companies that demand the highest standards can also support decent and safe jobs. Long term solutions to eradicating poverty are nearly always dependent on a healthy environment. WWF works to manage renewable resources sustainably and for the long term so they can keep producing resources and associated livelihoods in perpetuity. The recent focus on plastics has demonstrated the negative impacts that pollution has on the natural environment and on people, and businesses have a role in reducing pollution throughout the value chain all the way to what the end consumer does with the packaging or waste from a product. The broader message is that business needs to take full responsibility, from cradle to grave, which includes a responsibility to its consumers and the choices they make – be that what, how or when they consume and the impacts associated with this. Of course some companies will want a quick buck and will not manage their supply chains and pollution impacts sustainably &#8211; that’s more difficult to control. BFP: How can business, policy makers and NGOs better work together for a shared sustainable future? Dominic: Everyone has a role in delivering a sustainable future. Businesses have a role in ensuring their supply chains and products have positive and not negative impacts on producers and the environment, and take into account the materials used, energy use, pollution issues including plastics, impacts on water use and other natural resources. For example, food producers that use Palm Oil or Soy need to know where these ingredients come from and that they are guaranteed not to be causing deforestation. For Policy makers there is a critical role in legislation, and setting the “rules of the game” to incentivise sustainable behaviour. Many progressive businesses that go the extra mile call for a level playing field so that laggards don’t gain advantage from not investing long term. Facilitating dialogue, engaging the public, scrutinising government and corporate commitments and bringing new ideas to the table are all important roles for NGOs. The key is for different stakeholders to understand each other and work collaboratively towards a common goal – what the SDGs gives us is that shared purpose for all of us to work towards. BFP: Tell us more about UKSSD and the report you are launching? Dominic: I co-founded UKSSD to help drive action towards a sustainable UK. I believe it is critical that the UK demonstrates global leadership by getting our own house in order first before preaching to other countries. The universal nature of the SDGs provides a fantastic opportunity for us to do this. UKSSD is open to everyone – it is a truly multi-stakeholder network, with shared purpose to make the UK sustainable. UK consumers and businesses have a clear responsibility for their impacts, be they in their domestic location or where and how their products are made or disposed of. Measuring Up is a result of a huge effort made by many organisations and individuals who volunteered their time to “do their bit” towards this aim. The report is a stock take of progress across the UK against all the 169 SDG targets. While the government is busy dealing with Brexit, we’ve been busy preparing this as a contribution to help the UK identify where we can all focus our efforts to enhance sustainable development at home. It is a mirror for the country to reflect on. BFP: What is the change you are hoping the UKSSD and the report will create? Dominic: We want this report to galvanise more action. Ideally we’d like to see government recognise the SDGs as a fantastic post-Brexit opportunity, a new unifying vision that inspires all people. We’d like to see stronger government leadership on SDGs but with or without this we want to inspire anyone who shares our purpose to get together and take action where they can. BFP: For the Business Fights Poverty network, what is your call to action? Dominic: The SDGs are a powerful and transformative agenda and if we manage to deliver them we will have a world that is free from poverty, where inequality is reduced, where climate change is tackled, where production and consumption are sustainable and the natural world is able to support us now and into the future. We all have a role in making the SDGs a reality; businesses should look across their supply chains and products and think about how they relate to each of the 17 goals &#8211; are they supporting delivery of that goal? Or are your business activities making some goals and targets worse? Hardwire the SDGs and sustainable development into your business operations – if you get stuck find some like-minded folk to share the challenge – find some less obvious partners to work with! BFP: Business Fights Poverty is all about collaboration and learning. Would you mind sharing a little more about yourself? What does your day to day role look like? Dominic: I work as part of a small (but perfectly formed) team engaging with governments and business to mainstream environment into development. We work closely with other organisations to champion sustainable development. A particular focus is supporting and promoting the uptake of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), we recognise that if this ground-breaking set of goals and targets is taken up by governments and businesses around the world then we will go a long way towards achieving a sustainable future for everyone. The work we do is varied, we might be meeting with government officials, preparing briefings, writing evidence for parliamentary inquiries, speaking at events or working with partners on our plans and strategies. BFP: Who inspires you? Dominic: People like Gro Harlem Brundtland, mother of sustainable development since 1987; Paula Caballero, mother of SDGs and Kate Raworth, mother of doughnuts – I mean Doughnut Economics. Visionary women who hold the big picture and aren’t afraid of addressing complex interactions between people and nature to provide a better future. BFP: How do you stay motivated? Dominic: By focusing on the potential for change in the work that I do, the environmental and social challenges we are facing at this point in history are huge and daunting, my day job is to try and do something about it! BFP: What does personal success look like for you? Dominic: When I see individuals or organisations taking up my ideas so that they’re not my ideas anymore and joining the fight for a more sustainable world. BFP: What advice would you give to someone just starting out on their career? Dominic: We all share common challenges already. Look at the connections in your work to other social, economic and environmental issues and see how you can leverage greater impact from thinking through your work more broadly – more sustainably. Whatever sector you are in – private, public or third sector – you have an opportunity to make life better for other people beyond your job itself.",2018-07-03 06:43:44,Podcasts,Text,,✅,,,,,,,uploaded,,,,
401856,Tamsin Jones,https://businessfightspoverty.org/tamsin-jones,"Did you know that women represent just 28.8% of researchers worldwide, the global gender pay gap is 28% and women hold only 23.7% of parliamentary seats? Gender inequality continues in the upper echelons of decision-making: so where are the solutions? This week Katie Hyson, Director of Thought Leadership meets with Tamsin Jones. A lady whose first job was political adviser to South Australian Premier; since then Tamsin moved from Australia to London, where she helped drive the East London business legacy post Olympics 2012, to South Africa where she lead the expansion of private sector solutions for charity Mothers2mothers Africa, the leading non-governmental organisation helping women living with HIV to reduce transmission to their babies. Tamsin has since held posts as Senior Advisor to CDC’s Africa List – helping women CEOs and co-founded Cape Town’s Workshop17 – the Innovation Hub for Africa. During this interview, Tamsin examines why gender equality throughout the workplace is important, presenting her new joint venture: The Boardroom Africa as one solution to the low female representation on boards; as well as sharing her advice on how we can create equality and what it takes to be a successful female entrepreneur. BFP: Why The Boardroom Africa? Tamsin: From my time working on The Africa List I knew the numbers: Only 14% of Boards in Africa are women, similar to the European 18% and India 13%. I know that businesses with balanced and diverse Boards and leadership are doing on average 20% better than their peers, and I have seen the recent Hampton Alexander Review looking at UK FTSE 350 companies, where quotes for reasons of not having more women on Boards range excruciatingly from: ‘I don’t think women fit comfortably into the board environment’ …to… ‘Most women don’t want the hassle or pressure of sitting on a board’ Our aim with The Boardroom Africa is to address the excuses that this same review revealed: ‘All the ‘good’ women have already been snapped up’ ‘There aren’t that many women with the right credentials and depth of experience to sit on the board’ ‘We need to build the pipeline from the bottom &#8211; there just aren’t enough senior women in this sector’ My business partner, Marcia Ashong, and I set up The Boardroom Africa in 2016 with the vision – to create a simple, smart, virtual business that helps provide solutions to the lacking diversity within Boardrooms across the African continent. We began by mapping out the exceptional women in our own networks, spreading and sharing the invite to join as we went, checking in with each to see who is ‘Board ready,’ helping those who want additional training or certification. Simultaneously we’ve been building bridges into businesses through peer recommendations to ensure we help organisations find endorsed Board members and therefore working through the lack of trust barriers. I don&#8217;t believe that Board member selection needs to be a closed door boys only system any longer. We now have a network of over 500 Board ready women across Africa; every new Board placement is advertised to the entire network, creating an open marketplace and complete transparency. BFP: Do you think this is a solution for places outside Africa? Tamsin: The statistics are similar in countries and continents outside Africa and yes, we have already had interest from people outside of our geography, in fact we have made one placement in Pakistan. We hope we have built a smart online business that has the potential to scale. I would love for The Boardroom to extend beyond Africa, but I also want to ensure we keep measuring, gathering data and learning to ensure we do this wisely. BFP: What can organisations do right now to pro-actively ensure gender equality? Tamsin: My three recommendations: Check your unconscious bias. How are women progressing through your organisation? Is talent management working for everyone? I grew up thinking: gender equality! What’s all the fuss about? Because when we start out 50% of the workforce are women. It was so surprising for me when I began to get higher in business and realise there just weren’t any women around– there are still significant barriers, many of which are hidden. Without actively looking for them and asking questions, the solutions will remain hidden. Which leads me onto my second point – gather the data, measure the numbers. Interrogate where there’s a drop off of women from your business and why. Check your pay gap. This is all best practice right now and we just need to do it. Make sure that women are actively nurtured up through the business, ensuring your talent pipeline is working. Whether this is through sponsorship (by women or men) or increased focus and investment – the statistic of 50:50 women at low levels and 7% at Executive level needs fixing. No excuses. BFP: As a female serial entrepreneur what is your advise to others? Tamsin: First of all, get motivated and stay motivated. I find the best motivator is to focus on something I am really passionate about and then do what I am best at. I am passionate about more women being on Boards and I am good at creating networks and ecosystems: The Boardroom Africa brings these two things together. In terms of starting up and running a business – my biggest lesson was learnt during my Skoll MBA, which was, the importance of being all over the numbers. I find it easy to run on passion, but to scale and make real impacts I need to understand all parts of my business: how to structure the company, how the finance to doing, where and when to scale. I don&#8217;t shy away from these any more, but I had to make myself dive in. And thirdly, nurturing my supporters and sponsors. I used to think a sponsor was only ever invested in a single business idea, but now I know they are often investing in the person behind it because they believe in them. If I am now lucky enough to be supported, I will do everything I can to bring them with me on this journey and the next.",2018-08-23 11:30:39,Podcasts,Text,,✅,,,,,,,uploaded,,,,
401914,Laura Kelly,https://businessfightspoverty.org/laura-kelly,"Laura Kelly was until recently Team Leader for DFID’s Business Engagement Hub. With a career in sustainable development, her previous roles include: ActionAid, where she led their agriculture and trade policy work and The ONE campaign, where Laura was the European Policy Director. With degrees in agriculture and international development, Laura has also written and lectured on trade and development, as well as being part of the UK Delegation at WTO, G20 and G8 negotiations. BFP: Why is business important to the UK Government’s Department for International Development (DFID) Laura: DFID has a mission, to help countries move away from reliance on aid. As the private sector is the driver for economic development; businesses of all sizes, from multi-national corporations to small and medium sized enterprises, can contribute to sustainable development. Our Prime Minister for example recently visited a number of countries in Africa promoting private sector engagement; fostering responsible and inclusive business. Business engagement is an important part of governing and policy development across all UK Government’s Departments. Equally, DFID is a donor agency – we are experts in political and social economics; business provides important insight for us: we must listen, learn and understand from the business experts in economic and commercial development. BFP: What does your role as Leader of DFID’s Business Engagement Hub entail? Laura: Within DFID, my business engagement is often done on a programmatic basis. For example our ‘Business Innovation Facility’ works alongside companies to help them explore and advance new solutions to development issues. Airbus for instance is testing drones to deliver healthcare products in hard to reach places, whilst Barclays, Sainsbury’s and Unilever are trialling the application of blockchain to create transparency in supply chains. Doing business responsibly is also vital to the UK’s prosperity. This is another area I work on. For example we have an ‘Ethical Trading Initiative’ – which aims to help business move beyond legal requirements and adopt best practice approaches. Modern Slavery is something we have been working hard on. We want to help companies learn how to address this in a very practical way. BFP: How do you encourage sceptics that businesses can be a force for good? Laura: Companies increasingly see their long-term viability hinged on environmental and social issues. Companies doing this also tend to have good worker relationships and therefore are more likely to be here in the future. The UN’s Sustainable Development Goals, for example, cannot be achieved by one sector acting alone. We all need to work together. Businesses are already showing that they can help to drive change, beyond legislative adherence. Companies such as M&amp;S and Unilever have not only public commitments to delivering positive social change but are also being measured transparently on their efforts. BFP: Where do you see the greatest opportunity for lasting socio – economic development? Laura: I see two levers for change and lasting socio-economic development: For me the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are a great tool to mobilise people: The Millennium Goals showed us how successful getting focused can be. We made huge strides in, for example, life expectancy. I really hope the ‘2030 Goals’ will exceed expectations. We now need a renewed push and more collaboration, to achieve the targets. I am so glad that the SDG’s explicitly call out the need for more collaborations and partnerships [#17]. Virtually everything that Dfid does is in partnership. At Dfid we’re currently working on the targets and monitoring aspects: we’ll be delivering our first ‘Voluntary National Review’ next year and we are a strong supporter of the ‘World Benchmarking Alliance.’ The increasing importance of social and environmental factors to investors: BlackRock CEO, Larry Fink’s annual letter to all his major investment companies could make for real and lasting socio-economic shifts. BFP: What three trends are you seeing? Laura: The three trends in sustainable development and business that I am very aware of are: The change in corporate behaviour to be more social and environmentally focused: Large companies need to attract and retain talent. Millennial employees are rating environmental, social and governance issues as important factors in their decisions about who to work for, and businesses are responding. The work that Business Fights Poverty and the League of Intrapreneurs are doing shows this [The Social Innovation Systems Challenge]. People who would have once gone to NGOs or the public sector in order to work for organisations who share their values are now finding their ways into business. Short termism: When even Trump is saying: “Stop quarterly reporting and go to a six-month system.”[via his twitter feed on 17th August 2018] I think and hope it is about time for business to really shift to a longer-term outlook. The role of the Internet and social media: There is so much information available, and yes we might be midst a lot of ‘fake news’ talk, but the increased availability of information is a great way to make sustainable development accessible and meaningful to many more people. BFP: What is your ask to those reading this interview? Laura: I have two asks: Evidence based policy making is essential: The Business Fights Poverty network makes a real difference when we can have two-way information exchanges. So my first call to action is please share your stories and do feedback, whatever sector you are from, on what Dfid should be doing more of. Sign up to the UN SDGs: Businesses should be equal partners in the SDGs – it’s in their interests not others. The Business Compact and their ten principles, I do believe, is something we want to grow and spread. At the moment they have 9,500 businesses signed up, there are many more businesses than that registered in the UK alone. I would like to know how we can all work together to get more companies thinking about and engaging with the UN Sustainable Development Goals and make that number much higher? BFP: And what would be your advice to others just starting out in their career? Laura: Ultimately I would love to do myself out of a job, for us to solve poverty. Sadly, I think there will be much work to do in this space for many more years to come. My advice to others: Development is a great area to work in, there are more opportunities now than ever before and ways to contribute beyond working for NGOs or government – you can create real impact through working for business.",2018-09-20 07:09:12,Podcasts,Text,,✅,,,,,,,uploaded,,,,
402000,Maike von Heymann,https://businessfightspoverty.org/maike-von-heymann,"Anglo American is the globe’s sixth largest mining company, mining diamonds (through De Beers), copper, platinum and other precious metals, iron ore, coal and nickel in in Southern Africa, North and South America and Australia. With 87,000 employees, this UK headquartered company have been in operation for over 100 years. In this interview Maike von Heymann, Anglo American’s Socio-Economic Development and Partnership Manager, shares her insights on the progress of community engagement and the importance of partnerships – as Anglo American increasingly looks to long term economic development for the regions in which they operate. BFP: Why is socio-economic development important to Anglo American? Maike: At Anglo American we have just launched our new Sustainability Strategy as part of ‘FutureSmart Mining’. To ensure that we better meet society’s growing expectations for truly sustainable mining, we have set out a series of stretch goals relating to our host communities, the natural environment, and the governance of our industry, together with a new collaborative approach to regional economic development. My work focuses in particular on our commitments to support thriving communities – this encompasses livelihoods, health and education in the regions where we operate. Underpinning this work is the development and support of partnerships; only through strong partnerships we can enable scale and ensure sustainability. BFP: Anglo American has a long history of community engagement in emerging markets, how is this work evolving? Maike: At a bare minimum, mining permits and other licenses often come with legally binding or regulatory requirements that bind us into creating socio economic improvements with communities, however, in a positive way, we are increasingly moving from shorter-term programmes to longer-term strategic approaches aiming to develop economies that can deliver opportunities even after mine closure. Our experience shows that doing really good business &#8211; properly investing in and supporting community and regional development means that those progressing communities become advocates and ambassadors for our business. Where previously we might have seen protesting, we now have experiences of communities asking protesters to stop because they deem Anglo American as a community asset. To have a long-lasting positive legacy for the countries and communities where we operate, we must continue to put sustainability and longer-term strategic thinking at the core of our decision-making and planning. Our socio-economic development approach focuses on leveraging core business activities, improving the productivity of local economies and public institutions, and delivering benefits through partnerships. BFP: What does Anglo American’s community engagement look like in action? Maike: One example I am particularly excited about is a collaborative regional development platform, currently being piloted in Limpopo, South Africa. Limpopo is important to our diamond and platinum businesses, but the province is faced with enormous challenges; it has a population that has generally low literacy and skills levels, and high rates of unemployment. There is also a shortage of quality housing and limited infrastructure, including sanitation and potable water, which is a scarce resource. One company cannot fix all of this, a joined up approach, with a long term vision is needed. So instead of trying to help on the fringes in small areas within our host communities, we instead have jointly set up a collaborative regional development platform with partners that share a common vision for socio-economic development in the region. We are reaching out across the region and bring together relevant stakeholders, from government and NGOs to civil society and other businesses. The approach draws on a collective-impact model, which hinges on the idea that in order for organisations to create lasting solutions to social problems on a large scale, they need to coordinate their efforts and work together towards a clearly defined goal. The platform is already helping to catalyse collaboration and partnership on systemic, cross-sector, transformational sustainable development in the province. For example, working with spatial data on socio-economic and environmental aspects, we have been able to detail out the approach for existing priority sectors and various new priority sectors for development have been identified. We are currently looking at rolling this approach out to other countries where we operate. I don&#8217;t know many other examples of partnerships moving to such a multi-stakeholder platform approach and would welcome any thoughts or advice from the Business Fights Poverty network on the topic. For more information on this please see: http://southafrica.angloamerican.com/our-difference/transformation/our-transformation-pillars/mine-community-development/case-studies.aspx BFP: Does small and medium sized enterprise (SME) ecosystem development play a part in Anglo American’s socio economic development? Maike: Yes, absolutely. We have been operating enterprise development programmes globally since 1989 and today we have programmes in South Africa, Botswana, Chile, Peru and Brazil. Supporting local enterprise ecosystems is important to us and it’s an important consideration in our programme design. Our aim is to create sustainable economies in our host communities. This might take the form of capacity building of local institutions or supporting policy development. We know we are just one stakeholder in a much wider system, and that we won’t be present in a community forever, so we work hard to support the local public sector or wider civil society to ensure broad SME system impact for the long term. Mentoring and capacity building is often a value we can add to strengthen local ecosystems. BFP: How do you measure success? Maike: Measuring and tracking our return on investment (ROI) in community activities is important – it ensures we continue to get funding, time and commitment from the central business, it’s vital to our stakeholder engagement – for our investors, for our stakeholders in the regions in which we operate and for those of potentially new locations. We are trying to become better and measure not only outputs, but also outcomes of our programmes. For example we have developed a Socio-Economic Assessment Toolbox (SEAT), which shows us how our operations affect each community. And increasingly we are using a combination of qualitative and quantitative data and alongside trying to gather real time feedback. For example, the Connected Communities project engages monthly with stakeholders via mobile text message surveys, allowing us to understand how perceptions shift over time. Though texting has its limitations in terms of identifying underlying drivers, it works very well as an early flagging mechanism for community sentiment. BFP: What are top three trends you see and why are they important? Maike: My three top trends are: The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) – I see an increase in awareness from the private sector around the social challenges we’re facing – the SDGs really helped to frame these and more importantly the understanding that business has a critical contribution to make in addressing them. In Anglo American, I am encouraged that the SDGs are now being talked about by senior leaders and by business area heads as important to our company’s future success. The next step I keep coming back to is how do we ensure the long-term impact to the SDGs from the work we are doing? The importance of partnerships &#8211; we can only achieve long-term sustainable change if we work together. Being the sole contributor doesn&#8217;t make enough impact; each sector has an important role to play – now we just need to get better at working together. Shifts to long term – In some ways this was already in place for Anglo American, we were thinking longer term for our assets, for life-time cycling and decommissioning; now we are beginning to link this to community impacts and socio-economic development activities. We are seeing our core business really thinking about this, moving from short-term tactical activities to long-term strategic approaches, including socio-economic closure assessments, and incorporating this into plans earlier on. BFP: What ask do you have of the Business Fights Poverty network? Maike: I love learning from other industries, increasing my understanding from others, it helps me to be more innovative and effective. The Business Fights Poverty network really stretches my thinking, thank you. I am looking for ideas, inspiration and insight into what makes great partnerships, and how to ensure their scale, impact and longevity; if any readers of this article have advice, I would love to hear them.",2018-10-26 09:58:27,Podcasts,Text,,✅,,,,,,,uploaded,,,,
402070,Dr Donal Brown CBE,https://businessfightspoverty.org/dr-donal-brown-cbe,"During this interview Donal shares more on his new role as Associate Vice President of the Program Management Department at the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), and why he is convinced by the four Ps: public, private, producer partnerships. BFP: Tell us about your new role at IFAD? Donal: Arguably the heart of IFAD’s mission is to eliminate hunger, addressing Sustainable Development Goal number one: to end poverty in all forms and eliminating hunger, Goal two. IFAD is a bit of a hybrid between a specialized United Nations agency and an international financial institution. We have a large program of loans and grants for developing countries. Our investments focus on creating inclusive rural transformation &#8211; to help reduce rural poverty. Currently, small, very poor rural farmers produce 70% of the world’s food; at a time when the world&#8217;s population is increasing by 83 million a year and 80% of the world’s poor live in rural areas. The importance of helping small rural farmers to produce food, to be more productive and to also improve their own livelihoods has never been stronger. The way we do this is to loan money to countries that cannot otherwise afford rural investment. The money is targeted towards the very poorest and the most fragile, with the aims to: increase productivity of smallholder farmers in the rural areas; to help them access markets, so they can sell their food, get a better price and help supply rural and urban populations; and finally, to enhance their ability to cope with climate change. Smallholder farmers have always had to deal with changes in the weather, but as we&#8217;re seeing climate change is now accelerating. The impact on smallholder farmers who are the most poor and most vulnerable is accelerating too. My job, is to oversee the design implementation of our whole lending program, which next year will be $1.7 billion of loans. BFP: What do you see as being IFAD’s biggest challenges and opportunities? Donal: The world is changing rapidly. It&#8217;s not only about issues like climate change, but also globalization, access to markets and rapid urbanization that are impacting rural farmers and the pressures on our food supply. Small, poor, rural farmers are business people like any others; they aim to make money and to improve the lives of their family, to send their kids to school. But often their challenges include: lack of infrastructure to get their produce to markets – the roads don&#8217;t exist; niether do secure land tenure rights or their ability to improve their seed quality which could otherwise improve their farming technologies and techniques. A key in this is access to finance. Often smallholder farmers need only very small amounts of finance. But no one wants to lend any money to a small, poor, farmer that doesn&#8217;t have collateral and that doesn&#8217;t have land security. The huge challenge of climate change is becoming increasingly pressing. The rural smallholder farmers we work with are perhaps least able to adapt, these already incredibly vulnerable people are under threat as are the food sources they are generating. But there are opportunities too, there are technologies and innovations, which could make a real difference, for example: using digital technology to give farmers access to information: information about market prices, weather and crop alternatives, or innovations in seed varieties and innovations in financing. IFAD has been particularly involved in these areas. We have been working on group savings programmes where the trials have been so successful that some banks and microfinance institutions have now taken them on. And with Intel Corporation we have teamed up to increase small farmers&#8217; access to information through new Intel software that will help farmers make informed decisions on seed and fertilizer selection, harvest planning and sales management. But the scale of the need is great. It’s estimated that we will need around $210 billion per year of investment in agriculture if we are to achieve SDG number one and end hunger. It will take $38 billion a year to provide food security alone. The State of Food Security report 2018 showed for the third year in a row, the number of hungry people has gone up in this world. To me it&#8217;s completely unacceptable. Two areas of scale with potential are private sector engagement and partnerships. Public sector donors cannot provide the sort of money needed. It has to be about partnerships between the private sector, the public sector, and the inclusion of other domestic resources. And businesses have opportunities in these spaces too – not just in financing and supply chains, but also in developing innovations and technology, which in turn create new business income streams. My previous experience, trying to tackle the Ebola crisis has convinced me that harnessing cross sector expertise and working together is the only way to rapidly find lasting solutions. At IFAD, we talk about the four P&#8217;s: public, private, producer partnerships. Four examples from different global regions we are working on: In Nigeria we are working with a company called Olam on their supply chain. Together we support smallholder farmers to sell their crops into Olam, who in turn guarantee prices and provide additional farmer training. In Egypt, Heinz are providing training and quality control on tomatoes to large numbers of smallholder farmers working with IFAD. The results show a 33% increase in farmer incomes. In Indonesia, Mars is working with smallholder cocoa producers, as you can&#8217;t produce cocoa for chocolate very easily in large plantations. With Mars we are training on quality and on marketing for the farmers. Mars is providing a guaranteed market price, which again means the smallholder farmers produce a much better quality product and get a much better price for it too. And finally, in Central Asia, working with farmers, we&#8217;ve been able to innovate some of the Kashmir and Mohair natural fibers to create a new product, which is called Cashgora. It&#8217;s such high quality that the women producers are able to get much higher prices and likewise we are engaging business to help mechanise the processing, so together we can increase the quantity too. We can only make real transformations in poverty and particularly rural poverty by bringing the best of both worlds. At IFAD we can be an assembler of finance and an assembler of knowledge. We test things, we adapt, we ensure they work and then we help take them to scale. There&#8217;s no point doing things well, in a small way, we&#8217;ve got to scale. BFP: As someone with a CBE for their contribution to international development, what is your advice to others early in their career journey? Donal: Some people get over excited about the exotic countries or put off by the numbing statistics of international development, but if you can keep remembering the human faces &#8211; they will give you the motivation to keep going till you are in a position to really achieve something. I found that it can be quite difficult to get your first break in development, as in anything else, but my advice is to keep pushing. I think if you believe in yourself and you really have a passion for development, for the human face of the people you are trying to help then keep trying. But however big or small, I always I hope I can make this world just a little better. &nbsp; Donal Brown&#8217;s Biography: Beginning his career as a vet before a master’s in tropical animal health led him to the UK’s Department for International Development (DFID), Donald held a number of posts within DFID, including as the Director for Africa, managing 560 staff across the continent.

Josh joins us to dive into Be Broadcast’s latest data-driven report, Mission Control: The Climate Conversation, which analysed over 45,000 radio and TV segments across the UK. The findings are eye-opening: climate change is dramatically underrepresented compared to entertainment events like the Oscars, and when it does make headlines, the framing is overwhelmingly alarmist — think “ticking time bomb” and “disaster waiting to happen.” But what does this mean for the public’s understanding, emotional response, and willingness to act? Josh explains why our current approach to climate storytelling often alienates the very people we need to engage: the “movable middle.” He explores how brands, campaigners, and communicators can break through media fatigue and craft narratives that inspire hope, clarity, and meaningful action — without slipping into despair or denial. This isn’t just a climate story. It’s a media story. Josh pulls back the curtain on why climate coverage fades so quickly once the floods subside or the political drama ends, and what we can do to keep this vital conversation alive long-term. Whether you work in PR, journalism, public policy — or are simply someone who cares about the future of the planet — this episode will give you fresh insight and practical tools to help shift the narrative.
