TODO:

* Test with integrated vectorization
   * Multivector is working
   * Can we get images mapped??
   * We need DocIntelligence skill
* Update all TODOs in the code/docs
* Fix/add unit tests - check coverage
* LLMInputType and VectorFields have inconsistently named values
   * # Vector fields:
      # [X] text embedding field (embedding3) use_text_vector=True
      # [X] image embedding field (images/embedding) use_image_vector=True

      # Inputs for LLM:
      # [X] text sources , use_text_sources = True
      # [X] image sources , use_image_sources = True


To decide:
* For user data lake client, how often should we double check the ACL matches the oid, versus assuming the URLs convey that? (Like when fetching the image?)
   * add a note that we only check owner, not full access control
   * add owner check to each blob-related method (/list, /remove)
   * move fetch image into blobmanager
   * WHY ARE THERE NO OIDS on the uploaded sections????

Later:
Agentic: Incompatible since it doesnt retrieve images. We would need to do a follow-up search query to get each document, like filter: id eq 'x' or id eq 'y' or....
