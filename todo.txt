TODO:

* Fix/add unit tests - check coverage
* Add documentation
* Test with agentic
  * Add vectorizer for images field - special from https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/vector-search-vectorizer-ai-services-vision
  * Update the approaches to set image_sources appropriately in run_agentic_retrieval_approach
* Test with integrated vectorization
* Update all TODOs in the code/docs

Decide:
* In conftest, should I make a new env for vision? Currently I mashed it into the existing env, but it might be cleaner to have a separate one, as now I have to pass llm_inputs explicitly in the tests to turn off image responses.
* LLMInputType and VectorFields have inconsistently named values
