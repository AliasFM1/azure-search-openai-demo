TODO:

* Test with integrated vectorization
   * Multivector is working
   * Can we get images mapped??
   * We need DocIntelligence skill
* Update all TODOs in the code/docs
* Fix/add unit tests - check coverage

To decide:

* Is there overhead to making new client each time in blobmanager? what do we prefer?

Later:
Agentic: Incompatible since it doesnt retrieve images. We would need to do a follow-up search query to get each document, like filter: id eq 'x' or id eq 'y' or....
